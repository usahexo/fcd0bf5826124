<h1 id="Play-Poker-Like-Brigitte-Bardot-The-Ultimate-Guide"><a href="#Play-Poker-Like-Brigitte-Bardot-The-Ultimate-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Play Poker Like Brigitte Bardot: The Ultimate Guide"></a>Play Poker Like Brigitte Bardot: The Ultimate Guide</h1><p>Welcome to the thrilling, seductive world of Brigitte Bardot-style poker. There’s nothing like it. If you want to win at poker – and look like a movie star while you’re doing it – then this is the guide for you.</p>
<p>But first, a few basics. Poker is a card game that can be played by anywhere from two to ten players. The aim of the game is to achieve the best hand possible, using any combination of the five cards in your hand and the five cards on the table. The player with the best hand wins the pot, which is the total amount of money wagered during the course of the hand.</p>
<p>Poker can be played in a variety of different formats, but we’ll focus on Texas Hold’em, which is currently the most popular variant. In Texas Hold’em, each player is dealt two face-down cards, after which there is a round of betting. Then three community cards are placed face-up on the table, followed by another round of betting. Finally, a fourth community card is placed face-up (the turn), and a final round of betting takes place. The player with the best five-card poker hand using their two hole cards and the five community cards on the table wins the pot.</p>
<p>Got all that? Good. Now let’s take a look at how to play poker like Brigitte Bardot.</p>
<p>#1: Play stylishly</p>
<p>Bardot was one of Hollywood’s most stylish stars and she brought an element of glamour to everything she did – including poker. So make sure you dress appropriately for your game. A little glamour never goes amiss, so try wearing something sexy and flattering. And don’t forget to accessorize! A string of pearls or some sparkling bracelets will help complete your look.</p>
<p>#2: Use good table manners</p>
<p>Bardot was well known for her impeccable manners and her polite behaviour at all times – even when playing high stakes poker games! So make sure you adopt some good table manners too if you want to play like BB. Be respectful towards your opponents, don’t make any loud noises or excessive gestures, and remember to use your cutlery properly!</p>
<p>#3: Be charming and flirtatious</p>
<p>Bardot was one of Hollywood’s biggest sex symbols, and she used her natural sex appeal to great effect at the poker table. If you want to play like her, then you need to learn how to be charming and flirtatious with your opponents. Flattery always goes down well, so make sure you lavish your rivals with compliments whenever you can. And if someone manages to beat you – which they inevitably will – be sure to congratulate them graciously!</p>

<p>In learning how to play poker for fun, the first and most important step is to find a reputable online casino. The next step is learning how to play. Poker is a very simple game, but there are many different variations of the game. The following instructions are for Texas Hold’em, which is currently the most popular variation of poker.</p>
<p>To begin, all players are dealt two cards face down (hole cards). The player with the best hand at this point is known as the “front runner” or “favorite”. The dealer then places five communal cards, face up, in the middle of the table (the flop). Players now have an opportunity to bet on their hand. A round of betting takes place, in which players may either stay in (match the current bet) or fold (quit the hand, losing any bets placed thus far). After all players have either stayed in or folded, the dealer turns over another card (the turn), which also becomes part of everyone’s hand. Another round of betting ensues. Finally, the dealer flips over one more card (the river), completing everyone’s hand. A final round of betting takes place and then hands are revealed. The player with the best 5-card poker hand wins the pot.</p>
<p>There are a number of strategic decisions that must be made during a game of poker and it can take years to master all the nuances associated with playing well. However, by following some basic guidelines you can give yourself a decent chance of winning:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Play tight – In general, you should play fewer hands than your opponents. This will increase your chances of winning when you do hit a good hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bet aggressively – When you do have a good hand, put some pressure on your opponents by betting heavily. This will force them to make difficult decisions and could lead to them making costly mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use position to your advantage – Position is one of the most important aspects of poker and simply means being seated in a spot where you can act last on every betting round. Being patient and waiting for good hands while other players bust out can be extremely profitable. Assess each situation and figure out what’s best given your current position at the table.</p>
</li>
