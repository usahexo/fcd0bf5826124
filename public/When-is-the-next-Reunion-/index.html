        <h1 id="When-is-the-next-Reunion"><a href="#When-is-the-next-Reunion" class="headerlink" title="When is the next Reunion?"></a>When is the next Reunion?</h1><p>Planning a reunion can be difficult, with so many things to consider. But one question always comes up: when is the best time for the reunion?</p>
<p>There are a few things to think about when planning a reunion. The first is determining what time of year would work best for everyone. Some people might want to go during the summer, while others might prefer to wait until school is out or vacation season starts.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is the location. Some people might want to stay close to home, while others might want to travel somewhere new. If everyone agrees on a location, that can help make planning easier.</p>
<p>Once you’ve settled on a time and location, it’s time to start planning! Send out invitations and start making arrangements. You might have a busy year getting everything organized, but it will be worth it when you see your friends and family all together again.</p>
<h1 id="Who-plans-the-events"><a href="#Who-plans-the-events" class="headerlink" title="Who plans the events?"></a>Who plans the events?</h1><p>Today’s society is all about the events. From birthdays to weddings, and everything in between, somebody is always planning something. And while it may seem like these events just happen spontaneously, there is actually a lot of behind-the-scenes work that goes into making them happen. Who does all this planning?</p>
<p>Typically, it is the event planner who is responsible for creating and executing an event. This professional may work for a company or organization that specializes in putting on events, or they may be self-employed and work with clients on a one-on-one basis. No matter what their background or area of expertise, though, all event planners share some common traits.</p>
<p>First and foremost, successful event planners are organized and detail-oriented. They need to be able to oversee every aspect of an event from start to finish, and ensure that everything runs smoothly. They must also be good communicators, since they often have to coordinate with various vendors and other professionals in order to make an event happen. And lastly, they need to be creative problem solvers - when something goes wrong or there are unexpected complications, it’s up to the planner to come up with a solution that will keep the event on track.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for someone to help you plan your next big bash, start by talking to some local event planners. Chances are you’ll find one who is perfectly suited for the task at hand.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-does-it-cost-to-attend"><a href="#How-much-does-it-cost-to-attend" class="headerlink" title="How much does it cost to attend?"></a>How much does it cost to attend?</h1><p>The total cost of attendance for the 2017-2018 academic year is $63,000. This includes tuition, room and board, and fees.</p>
<h1 id="How-can-I-pay-for-it"><a href="#How-can-I-pay-for-it" class="headerlink" title="How can I pay for it?"></a>How can I pay for it?</h1><p>There are a variety of ways to finance your education at Bowdoin.

<h1 id="What-scholarships-are-available"><a href="#What-scholarships-are-available" class="headerlink" title="What scholarships are available?"></a>What scholarships are available?</h1><p>There are a number of scholarships available to incoming and current students. Some scholarships are based on merit, while others are based on financial need. Some examples include the [Name of Scholarship], the [Name of Scholarship], and the [Name of Scholarship].

<h1 id="What-is-the-average-student-loan-debt-at-graduation"><a href="#What-is-the-average-student-loan-debt-at-graduation" class="headerlink" title="What is the average student loan debt at graduation?"></a>What is the average student loan debt at graduation?</h1><p>The average student loan debt at graduation is $27,000. However, this number varies widely depending on the individual’s choice of school and major.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-included-in-the-cost"><a href="#What-is-included-in-the-cost" class="headerlink" title="What is included in the cost?"></a>What is included in the cost?</h1><p>When you are considering the cost of a task, it’s important to know what is included in that cost. For example, when you are considering the cost of having a task completed by a professional, there are some things you should know.</p>
<p>The first thing to consider is what services will be included in the cost. Often times, when you hire a professional to do a task for you, they will not only complete the task, but also provide you with advice and/or support. In other words, they will not just do the task for you, but also help guide you through it.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is whether or not the cost includes any supplies or equipment. For example, if you are hiring someone to paint your house, the cost will likely include the paint and brushes needed to complete the job. However, if you are hiring someone to landscape your yard, the cost may not include any plants or trees.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s important to consider any additional costs that may be associated with the task at hand. For example, if you are hiring someone to mow your lawn, they may charge an additional fee if there is a lot of grass to cut. Or if you are hiring someone to move furniture for you, they may charge an additional fee if there is a lot of heavy furniture to move.</p>
<p>So when considering the cost of a task, be sure to ask about what services are included in that cost and what additional costs may apply. This way, you can be sure that you’re aware of all of the expenses involved before making a decision.</p>
<h1 id="Are-there-any-restrictions-on-who-can-attend"><a href="#Are-there-any-restrictions-on-who-can-attend" class="headerlink" title="Are there any restrictions on who can attend?"></a>Are there any restrictions on who can attend?</h1><p>Yes, unfortunately there are some restrictions on who can attend. The retreat is for people aged 18 and over only and we cannot accept anyone with a criminal record.</p>
