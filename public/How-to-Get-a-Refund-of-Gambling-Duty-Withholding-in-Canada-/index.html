Gambling duty withholding is a tax that the Canadian government collects from gambling winnings. However, not everyone has to pay this tax. In this article, we will explain who is required to pay gambling duty withholding and how to get a refund if you have paid too much.</p>
<p>In Canada, gambling duty withholding is collected on all gambling winnings over CA$10,000. The tax rate is 10%. So, for every CA$10,000 in winnings, the government collects CA$1,000 in gambling duty withholding.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule. First of all, the tax does not apply to prizes won in Canadian lotteries or casino slot machines. It also does not apply to winnings from poker tournaments or other games of skill. Finally, it only applies to earnings from legal forms of gambling. So, if you earn money from an illegal gambling activity, such as blackjack or poker games run by an unlicensed operator, you are not required to pay gambling duty withholding.</p>
<p>If you have paid too much gambling duty withholding, you can apply for a refund. The process for getting a refund is fairly simple. You can either submit an application online or send a letter to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). When submitting your application, be sure to include your name and social insurance number (SIN), as well as the date and amount of the winnings that were subject to the tax.</p>
<p>It can take up to four weeks for the CRA to process your application and issue a refund cheque. So, if you are expecting a large jackpot win or other large lump sum payment, it is best to start the process early so that you do not have to wait long for your money.</p>
<p>As long as you meet the eligibility requirements and comply with all applicable rules and regulations, getting a refund of gambling duty withholding in Canada is relatively easy. So, if you have questions about this tax or need help filing an application for a refund, be sure to contact the CRA or your trusted tax professional.</p>

Thankfully, there are a few ways to do this, and we’ll outline them for you here.</p>
<p>First of all, it’s important to understand that the gambling duty withholding rate is 15%. This means that if you win $100 while gambling in Canada, the Canadian government will keep $15 and you will receive $85.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to get your money back from the Canadian government. The easiest way is probably to claim your winnings as income on your taxes. This can be done by filing a T1 tax return, and you can use Form T4A – Statement of Winnings and Prizes to report your winnings.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to claim your winnings as income, you can also apply for a refund of the gambling duty withheld. To do this, you’ll need to complete Form GST190 – Application for Refund of Gambling Duty Withheld and mail it into Revenue Canada.</p>
<p>It can take up to eight weeks for the government to process your application, so be sure to apply well in advance of when you need your money. Keep in mind that you can only apply for a refund if the amount of gambling duty withheld was more than $50.</p>
<p>Finally, another option is to bring a lawsuit against the Canadian government. This is definitely the more difficult option, but it may be worth considering if the amount of money that was withheld was significant.</p>
<p>Hopefully one of these options will work for you and you can get your money back from the Canadian government. Good luck!</p>

<p>Robert had filed a complaint with the Quebec Ombudsman in 2016, stating that Revenue Quebec had been wrongfully withholding funds from his bank account since 2009. The funds had been withheld as part of Revenue Quebec’s efforts to collect taxes on gambling winnings.</p>
<p>In a decision announced on September 12, 2018, the Quebec Superior Court ruled in Robert’s favour, ordering Revenue Quebec to reimburse him for the withheld funds plus interest.</p>
<p>The Court found that Revenue Quebec had no authority to withhold money from gambling winnings without a court order. It also ruled that the fees charged by Revenue Quebec for processing gambling taxes were illegal.</p>
<p>Revenue Quebec has said it will appeal the decision.</p>

<p>An Ontario man is getting an $8,000 refund from the Canada Revenue Agency after they withheld money from his Winnings in error. The man, who asked not to be identified, says he was pleasantly surprised when he received a letter from the CRA stating that they had made a mistake and would be issuing him a full refund.</p>
<p>“I was really happy,” said the man. “I didn’t think I’d ever see that money again.”</p>
<p>The man says he was gambling at a casino in Niagara Falls last year when he won just over $8,000. The casino withheld 30 per cent of his winnings for gambling duty, but the CRA later determined that no such tax applies to casino winnings.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the CRA says the mistake happened because of an input error and that they are working to ensure it doesn’t happen again.</p>

<p>But the gambler took on the taxman and after a two-year legal battle, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has ruled in his favour, declaring that his winnings were not taxable.</p>
<p>“The tribunal found that because of the way in which I’d incurred the winnings – through a mixture of luck and skill – they were not assessable as ordinary income,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m obviously over the moon with the outcome. It’s been a long two years but it was worth it.”</p>
<p>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) had argued that since the gambler had used “skill and knowledge” to win the money, it should be considered taxable income.</p>
<p>But the tribunal disagreed, ruling that while skill was involved, it was not the predominant factor in his victory.</p>
