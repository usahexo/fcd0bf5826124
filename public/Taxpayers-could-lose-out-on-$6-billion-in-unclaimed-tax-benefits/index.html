This is largely due to the fact that many people are not aware of the various tax breaks and deductions available to them.</p>
<p>One of the biggest sources of unclaimed tax benefits is the home mortgage interest deduction. The majority of taxpayers who claim this deduction do not itemize their deductions, which means they are missing out on potential savings.</p>
<p>Other common tax breaks that go unused include the child tax credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. Many taxpayers do not realize that they are eligible for these credits, or they fail to claim them properly.</p>
<p>If you want to make sure that you are taking advantage of all of the available tax breaks, it is important to consult with a qualified accountant or tax preparer. They can help you determine which credits and deductions you qualify for, and help you file your taxes correctly.</p>
<p>If you haven’t filed your taxes yet, there’s still time to take advantage of some of these tax breaks. Contact a qualified accountant today to get started!</p>
<h1 id="1-6-billion-in-potential-tax-savings-goes-to-waste-each-year"><a href="#1-6-billion-in-potential-tax-savings-goes-to-waste-each-year" class="headerlink" title="$1.6 billion in potential tax savings goes to waste each year"></a>$1.6 billion in potential tax savings goes to waste each year</h1><p>It’s tax season, and as people across the country scramble to file their taxes, they likely don’t realize that $1.6 billion in potential tax savings goes to waste each year. That’s according to new research from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which finds that businesses and individuals could save billions of dollars by making better use of available technology.</p>
<p>“In general, people are unaware of the technology options that can help them save money on their taxes,” said NIST economist Stephen Maloney in a statement. “Our study found a lot of potential for savings by using existing technology in more effective ways.”</p>
<p>For example, businesses could save an estimated $1 billion each year by making better use of tax software and automating tax processes. Individuals could save an additional $600 million annually by taking similar measures.</p>
<p>Other areas where businesses and individuals could save money include:</p>
<p>-Using cloud computing services rather than on-premises IT infrastructure (savings of up to $700 million annually)<br>-Optimizing supply chains through improved forecasting and coordination (up to $350 million saved)<br>-Improving energy efficiency in buildings (up to $370 million saved)</p>
<p>While the potential savings identified in the NIST report are substantial, it’s important to note that they’re only estimates. In order to achieve these savings, taxpayers would need to adopt proven technological solutions that are already available today. So what’s stopping people from taking advantage of these cost-saving measures?</p>
<p>In some cases, it may be a lack of awareness about the options that are available. In other cases, it may be a reluctance to adopt new technologies or change long-standing processes. Whatever the reason, there’s no doubt that businesses and individuals could benefit from using technology more effectively when it comes to taxes.</p>
<h1 id="6-out-of-10-taxpayers-don’t-itemize-for-playing-losses-costing-them-big-time"><a href="#6-out-of-10-taxpayers-don’t-itemize-for-playing-losses-costing-them-big-time" class="headerlink" title="6 out of 10 taxpayers don’t itemize for playing losses, costing them big time"></a>6 out of 10 taxpayers don’t itemize for playing losses, costing them big time</h1><p>According to the [ National Taxpayers Union ] ( <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ntu.org/">https://www.ntu.org/</a> ) , nearly two-thirds of taxpayers don’t itemize their deductions, including those who could have deducted gambling losses in a given year. This costs taxpayers billions of dollars every year.</p>
<p>In fact, almost all of the $2 billion in gambling losses deducted by individual taxpayers in 2014 were claimed by people who didn’t itemize their deductions. That means that these folks gave up more than $1.6 billion in potential refunds by not taking this deduction.</p>
<p>If you’re one of the millions of Americans who don’t itemize your deductions, and you gambled last year, you may be missing out on a tax break. You can deduct your gambling losses if you itemize your deductions on your tax return . But, most people don’t bother to do this because they think it’s too complicated or they don’t think they’ll get a refund anyway.</p>
<p>It’s worth taking the time to learn about the deduction for gambling losses if you’re one of those people. The deduction can really add up if you’ve had a losing streak at the casino or racetrack.</p>
<p>Just how much can you claim as a deduction for gambling losses? In most cases, you can deduct your losses up to the amount of your winnings. So, if you won $1,000 but lost $2,000 gambling last year, you can claim a deduction for $1,000 .</p>
<p>This is an “above-the-line” deduction, which means that it reduces your taxable income directly. You don’t have to itemize your deductions to take advantage of it . And, if you’re subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), this deduction will still lower your tax bill .</p>
<h1 id="Missing-out-on-valuable-tax-breaks-the-cost-of-not-itemizing-your-deductions"><a href="#Missing-out-on-valuable-tax-breaks-the-cost-of-not-itemizing-your-deductions" class="headerlink" title="Missing out on valuable tax breaks: the cost of not itemizing your deductions"></a>Missing out on valuable tax breaks: the cost of not itemizing your deductions</h1><p>There are a lot of compelling reasons to itemize your deductions on your tax return: you can lower your taxable income, reduce your overall tax bill, and sometimes receive valuable tax breaks. However, there are also some compelling reasons not to itemize: it can be time consuming and complex, and if you don’t qualify for many itemized deductions, it may not be worth your time.</p>
<p>Despite these factors, millions of taxpayers still choose to itemize their deductions each year. In fact, in 2016 nearly 30 million taxpayers (roughly one-third of all filers) chose to itemize their deductions. So what makes itemizing such a popular choice?</p>
<p>For many taxpayers, the main benefit of itemizing is that it allows them to deduct certain expenses that they wouldn’t be able to deduct if they took the standard deduction. Some of the most common itemized deductions include mortgage interest, property taxes, charitable donations, and state and local income taxes.</p>
<p>These deductions can add up quickly and can help reduce your taxable income significantly. For example, if you have a mortgage with a $10,000 interest payment, a $5,000 property tax bill, and make $1,000 in charitable donations, you would have a total of $16,000 in itemized deductions. This would lower your taxable income by $16,000, resulting in a tax savings of several thousand dollars.</p>
<p>In addition to the above items, there are a number of other valuable tax breaks that can be claimed through itemization. These include the write-off for unreimbursed employee expenses, the home office deduction, the student loan interest deduction and more. And while not everyone will qualify for all of these deductions, those who do can save a significant amount of money on their taxes.</p>
<p>So why would someone choose not to itemize? The main reason is that if you don’t qualify for many itemized deductions, it may not be worth your time. The standard deduction is much simpler to claim than itemizing and is available to all taxpayers regardless of their income or filing status. In 2016 the standard deduction was $6,300 for single taxpayers and $12,600 for married couples filing jointly.</p>
<p>This may seem like a small amount compared to the potential savings from itemizing your deductions; but if your total miscellaneous expenses (such as unreimbursed employee expenses mentioned earlier) are less than $6,300 (for single taxpayers) or $12,600 (for married couples), then it would be more advantageous to take the standard deduction rather than bother with itemizing.</p>
<h1 id="Why-you-should-always-itemize-your-deductions-even-if-you-have-playing-losses"><a href="#Why-you-should-always-itemize-your-deductions-even-if-you-have-playing-losses" class="headerlink" title="Why you should always itemize your deductions, even if you have playing losses"></a>Why you should always itemize your deductions, even if you have playing losses</h1><p>Are you someone who engages in a lot of gambling activities throughout the year? If so, there’s a good chance that you’re taking the standard deduction when you file your taxes. But if you have losses from gambling, you may be wondering if it makes sense to itemize your deductions after all.</p>
<p>The answer is, unequivocally, yes. Even though your gambling losses may seem like they wipe out any potential benefit of itemizing, it’s still worth doing so because of all of the other deductions you could be eligible for.</p>
<p>For starters, there’s the mortgage interest deduction. If you own a home, chances are you pay a lot of interest on your mortgage every year. By itemizing your deductions, you can shave a significant amount off of your taxable income.</p>
<p>There are also many other deductions that could save you money on your taxes, such as those for charitable contributions and medical expenses. Of course, these deductions vary from person to person depending on their individual circumstances, so it’s important to talk to a tax professional to see if itemizing is right for you.</p>
<p>But even if some of your potential deductions aren’t as large as the ones mentioned above, it’s still worth taking the time to itemize them. After all, every little bit counts when it comes to reducing your taxable income.</p>
<p>So if you have any gambling losses from this year or in years past, don’t forget to include them when you file your taxes. It may not seem like it’s worth the hassle at first glance, but trust us – it is!</p>
