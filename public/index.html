The game can be played with any number of players, but it is best with at least six. Players are also required to have two soccer balls.</p>
<p>To set up the game, divide the players into two teams, Team A and Team B. Position Team A on one side of the room and Team B on the other. Have each player stand in a column, with the first player in line facing the wall.</p>
<p>Next, place the two soccer balls at opposite ends of the playing area. One ball should be placed near Team A’s end line and the other ball should be placed near Team B’s end line.</p>
<p>The game begins with the first player in each team taking a turn kicking one of the soccer balls. The player must kick the ball so that it goes across the playing area and bounces off of one of the walls before ending up at the other team’s end line. If a player misses or kicks their ball out of bounds, they must retrieve it and then take another turn.</p>
<p>If a player successfully kicks their ball so that it goes across and bounces off of one of the walls before ending up at the other team’s end line, their team earns one point. The first team to earn five points wins!</p>

So, how do we go about winning at double soccer ball roulette?</p>
<p>Well, as with most things in life, it’s all about learning the rules and using them to your advantage. In double soccer ball roulette, there are two balls instead of one - and each one has its own designated slot on the wheel. As you might expect, the odds are slightly different for each slot, so it’s important to do your research before placing any bets.</p>
<p>There are various strategies that can be employed when playing double soccer ball roulette; some people prefer to spread their bets out across a range of different numbers, while others prefer to focus on just a few high-odds options. Whichever strategy you choose to use, make sure you always stick to it! Changing your bets partway through a game is only going to increase your chances of losing money.</p>
<p>So, now you know how to play and how to win - what are you waiting for? Get yourself down to your nearest casino and start raking in the cash!</p>

<p>To play, all you need is a friend, two soccer balls and some cash. The game starts by each player putting an equal amount of cash into the center of a table. One ball is then placed under each of the soccer balls. The players then take turns removing one ball at a time. If both balls are soccer balls, the player keeps the money. If one ball is a soccer ball and one is not, the non-soccer ball is revealed and the player loses the money wagered. If both balls are not soccer balls, then both balls are revealed and the player loses their money.</p>
<p>The game can be fast paced and exciting as players take turns quickly removing balls to see if they are lucky enough to get two soccer balls. With so much potential to win or lose money quickly, Double Soccer Ball Roulette can be a thrilling experience!</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Nevada-to-Repeal-Gambling-Laws-in-Hopes-of-Boosting-Tourism"><a href="#Nevada-to-Repeal-Gambling-Laws-in-Hopes-of-Boosting-Tourism" class="headerlink" title="Nevada to Repeal Gambling Laws in Hopes of Boosting Tourism"></a>Nevada to Repeal Gambling Laws in Hopes of Boosting Tourism</h1><p>Nevada is on the verge of repealing its gambling laws in hopes of boosting tourism. The state has been struggling to compete with other gambling destinations such as Macau and Singapore, and officials believe that repealing the laws will make Nevada more attractive to tourists.</p>
<p>The repeal would allow casinos to offer a wider variety of games, including roulette, poker, and blackjack. It would also allow casinos to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval is in support of the repeal, and he believes that it could bring in an extra $1 billion in revenue each year. He also believes that it will create jobs and stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>Opponents of the repeal argue that it will lead to more crime and increased addiction rates. They also argue that it will harm small businesses that are not affiliated with casinos.</p>
<p>The repeal is expected to be voted on in early 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Gambling-Laws-are-Outdated-and-Need-to-be-Changed"><a href="#Why-Gambling-Laws-are-Outdated-and-Need-to-be-Changed" class="headerlink" title="Why Gambling Laws are Outdated and Need to be Changed"></a>Why Gambling Laws are Outdated and Need to be Changed</h1><p>Gambling laws in the United States are outdated and in desperate need of change. The laws were written over 100 years ago and have not been updated since then. They are no longer relevant in today’s society and do not reflect the current views on gambling.</p>
<p>The gambling laws are confusing and difficult to understand. They are written in a way that is difficult to follow and apply to modern day gambling activities. This leads to confusion among law enforcement officials, casino operators, and the public.</p>
<p>The outdated gambling laws also create tension between the states and the federal government. The states want more control over gambling within their borders, while the federal government wants to maintain a strong grip on gambling throughout the country. This tension creates conflict and prevents progress on updating the laws.</p>
<p>The outdated gambling laws also impact the economy. Casino operators generate billions of dollars in revenue each year, which contributes to the economy. However, because of the outdated laws, a large portion of this revenue goes to illegal operations. This hurts the economy and could be avoided if the gambling laws were updated.</p>
<p>It is clear that the gambling laws need to be updated. They are outdated, confusing, and create conflict between the states and federal government. They also hurt the economy. It is time for Congress to address this issue and update these laws for the benefit of all involved.</p>
<h1 id="The-Negative-Effects-of-Gambling-Laws"><a href="#The-Negative-Effects-of-Gambling-Laws" class="headerlink" title="The Negative Effects of Gambling Laws"></a>The Negative Effects of Gambling Laws</h1><p>Gambling is one of the most popular activities in the world, enjoyed by people of all ages and from all walks of life. While for many people gambling is a harmless pastime, for others it can be a source of great harm. This is particularly true when gambling is undertaken in an illegal or unregulated manner.</p>
<p>The negative effects of gambling laws can be felt on both the individual and the societal level. On an individual level, gambling can lead to financial hardship, addiction, and other health problems. On a societal level, gambling can contribute to crime and social disharmony.</p>
<p> financial hardship</p>
<p>One of the most common negative effects of gambling laws is financial hardship. This often occurs when people become addicted to gambling and lose large sums of money. Gambling can also lead to bankruptcy, as was the case for former NFL player Kimmie Meissner. In 2012, Meissner was forced to file for bankruptcy after she lost over $1 million through online gambling.[1]</p>
<p>addiction</p>
<p>Another common negative effect of gambling laws is addiction. Gambling addiction can be very harmful both physically and mentally. It can cause people to lose control over their lives, leading to problems such as financial hardship, relationship breakdowns, and even suicide.[2]</p>
<p>health problems</p>
<p>Gambling can also lead to health problems such as stress, anxiety, and depression. These conditions can have a serious impact on a person’s quality of life and may require treatment from a doctor or psychologist.[3]</p>
<h1 id="The-Positive-Effects-of-Gambling-Laws"><a href="#The-Positive-Effects-of-Gambling-Laws" class="headerlink" title="The Positive Effects of Gambling Laws"></a>The Positive Effects of Gambling Laws</h1><p>The legalization of gambling has always been a controversial topic. There are people who argue that gambling can have positive effects on society, while others argue that it is nothing more than a waste of money and can have negative consequences. This article will explore the positive effects of gambling laws.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of legalizing gambling is that it can generate revenue for the government. This money can be used to fund important programs and services, such as education and healthcare. In addition, gambling can create jobs and boost the economy. For example, when a new casino opens in a city, it often creates hundreds of jobs in the area.</p>
<p>Gambling can also be fun and entertaining. It allows people to take a break from their everyday lives and experience something different. Gambling can also be exciting, especially when there is a lot of money at stake.</p>
<p>Another benefit of gambling laws is that they help to regulate the industry. This means that there are rules and regulations in place that protect consumers and ensure that gambling is fair and safe. Without these laws, the gambling industry would be unregulated and there would be no way to prevent fraud or crime.</p>
<p>Finally, gambling can have social benefits. It can help to bring people together and create a sense of community. Gambling can also help to relieve boredom or stress and provide an outlet for emotions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are many positive effects of legalizing gambling laws. Gambling can generate revenue for the government, create jobs and boost the economy, be entertaining and socially beneficial, and help to regulate the industry. While there are some risks associated with gambling, the benefits outweigh the negatives for most people.</p>
<h1 id="How-Gambling-Laws-Impact-Victims"><a href="#How-Gambling-Laws-Impact-Victims" class="headerlink" title="How Gambling Laws Impact Victims"></a>How Gambling Laws Impact Victims</h1><p>The link between gambling and crime is well established. Problem gambling can lead to financial difficulties, family problems and even criminal activity as people struggle to get their hands on money to fuel their addiction.</p>
<p>But what about the victims of gambling-related crimes? How do the laws around gambling impact them?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no easy answers. In many cases, the victims of gambling-related crime are not given the same level of protection as other victims of crime. This can be due to a number of factors, including outdated and confusing laws, a lack of understanding about the impact of problem gambling and a perception that gambling-related crimes are less serious than other crimes.</p>
<p>As a result, many victims feel like they are not taken seriously by police and other authorities, and they can often find it difficult to get the support they need.</p>
<p>This needs to change. Victims of gambling-related crime should be given the same level of protection and support as any other victim of crime. The laws around gambling need to be updated and clarified, and authorities should be trained in how to recognise and respond to gambling-related crimes.</p>
<p>Only then will we be able to ensure that victims receive the help they need and deserve.</p>

        <h1 id="How-to-Get-a-Refund-of-Gambling-Duty-Withholding-in-Canada"><a href="#How-to-Get-a-Refund-of-Gambling-Duty-Withholding-in-Canada" class="headerlink" title="How to Get a Refund of Gambling Duty Withholding in Canada"></a>How to Get a Refund of Gambling Duty Withholding in Canada</h1><p>If you are a Canadian gambler, you may be wondering how to get a refund of gambling duty withholding. Gambling duty withholding is a tax that the Canadian government collects from gambling winnings. However, not everyone has to pay this tax. In this article, we will explain who is required to pay gambling duty withholding and how to get a refund if you have paid too much.</p>
<p>In Canada, gambling duty withholding is collected on all gambling winnings over CA$10,000. The tax rate is 10%. So, for every CA$10,000 in winnings, the government collects CA$1,000 in gambling duty withholding.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule. First of all, the tax does not apply to prizes won in Canadian lotteries or casino slot machines. It also does not apply to winnings from poker tournaments or other games of skill. Finally, it only applies to earnings from legal forms of gambling. So, if you earn money from an illegal gambling activity, such as blackjack or poker games run by an unlicensed operator, you are not required to pay gambling duty withholding.</p>
<p>If you have paid too much gambling duty withholding, you can apply for a refund. The process for getting a refund is fairly simple. You can either submit an application online or send a letter to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). When submitting your application, be sure to include your name and social insurance number (SIN), as well as the date and amount of the winnings that were subject to the tax.</p>
<p>It can take up to four weeks for the CRA to process your application and issue a refund cheque. So, if you are expecting a large jackpot win or other large lump sum payment, it is best to start the process early so that you do not have to wait long for your money.</p>
<p>As long as you meet the eligibility requirements and comply with all applicable rules and regulations, getting a refund of gambling duty withholding in Canada is relatively easy. So, if you have questions about this tax or need help filing an application for a refund, be sure to contact the CRA or your trusted tax professional.</p>

Thankfully, there are a few ways to do this, and we’ll outline them for you here.</p>
<p>First of all, it’s important to understand that the gambling duty withholding rate is 15%. This means that if you win $100 while gambling in Canada, the Canadian government will keep $15 and you will receive $85.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to get your money back from the Canadian government. The easiest way is probably to claim your winnings as income on your taxes. This can be done by filing a T1 tax return, and you can use Form T4A – Statement of Winnings and Prizes to report your winnings.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to claim your winnings as income, you can also apply for a refund of the gambling duty withheld. To do this, you’ll need to complete Form GST190 – Application for Refund of Gambling Duty Withheld and mail it into Revenue Canada.</p>
<p>It can take up to eight weeks for the government to process your application, so be sure to apply well in advance of when you need your money. Keep in mind that you can only apply for a refund if the amount of gambling duty withheld was more than $50.</p>
<p>Finally, another option is to bring a lawsuit against the Canadian government. This is definitely the more difficult option, but it may be worth considering if the amount of money that was withheld was significant.</p>
<p>Hopefully one of these options will work for you and you can get your money back from the Canadian government. Good luck!</p>

<p>Robert had filed a complaint with the Quebec Ombudsman in 2016, stating that Revenue Quebec had been wrongfully withholding funds from his bank account since 2009. The funds had been withheld as part of Revenue Quebec’s efforts to collect taxes on gambling winnings.</p>
<p>In a decision announced on September 12, 2018, the Quebec Superior Court ruled in Robert’s favour, ordering Revenue Quebec to reimburse him for the withheld funds plus interest.</p>
<p>The Court found that Revenue Quebec had no authority to withhold money from gambling winnings without a court order. It also ruled that the fees charged by Revenue Quebec for processing gambling taxes were illegal.</p>
<p>Revenue Quebec has said it will appeal the decision.</p>

<p>An Ontario man is getting an $8,000 refund from the Canada Revenue Agency after they withheld money from his Winnings in error. The man, who asked not to be identified, says he was pleasantly surprised when he received a letter from the CRA stating that they had made a mistake and would be issuing him a full refund.</p>
<p>“I was really happy,” said the man. “I didn’t think I’d ever see that money again.”</p>
<p>The man says he was gambling at a casino in Niagara Falls last year when he won just over $8,000. The casino withheld 30 per cent of his winnings for gambling duty, but the CRA later determined that no such tax applies to casino winnings.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the CRA says the mistake happened because of an input error and that they are working to ensure it doesn’t happen again.</p>

<p>But the gambler took on the taxman and after a two-year legal battle, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has ruled in his favour, declaring that his winnings were not taxable.</p>
<p>“The tribunal found that because of the way in which I’d incurred the winnings – through a mixture of luck and skill – they were not assessable as ordinary income,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m obviously over the moon with the outcome. It’s been a long two years but it was worth it.”</p>
<p>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) had argued that since the gambler had used “skill and knowledge” to win the money, it should be considered taxable income.</p>
<p>But the tribunal disagreed, ruling that while skill was involved, it was not the predominant factor in his victory.</p>

Because of this, an increasing number of people are choosing to play these games online. However, while many enjoy doing so safely and without any problems, others have unfortunately experienced a range of different issues. So, if you’re thinking of playing casino games online yourself, it’s important to be aware of the various ways in which you can do so safely and enjoyably.</p>
<h1 id="1-Choose-The-Right-Casino"><a href="#1-Choose-The-Right-Casino" class="headerlink" title="1: Choose The Right Casino"></a>1: Choose The Right Casino</h1><p>The first step to playing casino games safely and enjoyably online is by choosing the right casino. This may seem like a daunting task given how many casinos are available online, but there are a few key things you can look for which will help make your decision easier. Firstly, always research a casino thoroughly before signing up with them. Check out reviews from independent sources to get an idea of what others have experienced. Secondly, make sure that the casino is licensed and regulated by a reputable authority. This protects you as the player in case anything goes wrong. Finally, take advantage of free spins and other bonuses offered by the casino to try them out before committing your own money.</p>
<h1 id="2-Play-Responsibly"><a href="#2-Play-Responsibly" class="headerlink" title="2: Play Responsibly"></a>2: Play Responsibly</h1><p>One of the most important things to remember when playing casino games online is to do so responsibly. This means setting limits on both how much money you’re willing to lose and also how much time you’re willing to spend playing. It’s easy to get carried away when enjoying these games and lose track of time or money, but it’s important to stay mindful of both in order to ensure you enjoy your experience without any negative consequences.</p>
<h1 id="3-Stick-To-Licensed-And-Reputable-Sites"><a href="#3-Stick-To-Licensed-And-Reputable-Sites" class="headerlink" title="3: Stick To Licensed And Reputable Sites"></a>3: Stick To Licensed And Reputable Sites</h1><p>As mentioned earlier, it’s vital that you only play at licensed and regulated casinos in order to protect yourself as a player. Not only does this give you recourse should something go wrong, but it also ensures that the site is legitimate and trustworthy. There are many unlicensed and unregulated sites operating online which may not be as safe as they seem, so it’s best not to take any chances and stick with well-known and reputable brands instead.</p>
<h1 id="4-Use-Secure-Banking-Methods"><a href="#4-Use-Secure-Banking-Methods" class="headerlink" title="4: Use Secure Banking Methods"></a>4: Use Secure Banking Methods</h1><p>When playing casino games online, it’s important to use secure banking methods in order to protect your funds. This means using trusted payment providers such as PayPal or Visa instead of giving your financial information directly to the casino. This way, if anything goes wrong with either the casino or payment provider, your funds will be protected and you may be able to get them back.</p>
<h1 id="5-Set-Rules-And-Limits-In-Advance"><a href="#5-Set-Rules-And-Limits-In-Advance" class="headerlink" title="5: Set Rules And Limits In Advance"></a>5: Set Rules And Limits In Advance</h1><p>As mentioned previously, it’s important to set rules and limits for yourself in advance when playing casino games online. This includes knowing how much money you’re willing to lose as well as how long you want to play for each session. By setting these limits in advance, you can avoid any unwanted surprises down the road and ensure that you always enjoy your gaming experience within sensible boundaries.</p>

<h1 id="New-To-Online-Gambling-Start-Here"><a href="#New-To-Online-Gambling-Start-Here" class="headerlink" title="New To Online Gambling? Start Here!"></a>New To Online Gambling? Start Here!</h1><p>There are many different ways to gamble online. Which one is right for you?</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is decide what type of gambler you are. Do you want to bet on sports, play casino games, or bet on horses?</p>
<p>Once you know what type of gambler you are, you need to find a reputable online gambling site. Do your research and read reviews before signing up.</p>
<p>Make sure the site is licensed and regulated in a reputable jurisdiction. If something goes wrong, you’ll want to be sure that you can get your money back.</p>

Unfortunately, not everyone understands how to gamble safely and enjoyably online. In this article, we’re going to go over some important tips for doing just that.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it’s important to understand the games you’re playing. If you’re playing a game that you don’t understand, you’re much more likely to make risky bets and lose money. Instead, focus on the games that you know inside and out. This will help you make smart decisions when it comes to your bets.</p>
<p>Next, be sure to set a budget and stick to it. Gambling can be addictive, and if you’re not careful, you could easily end up spending more than you intended. By setting a budget and sticking to it, you’ll help keep yourself in check and avoid costly mistakes.</p>
<p>Finally, always gamble responsibly. This means avoiding betting money that you can’t afford to lose and staying away from games that are likely to result in addiction. By following these tips, you can enjoy gambling safely and responsibly online without risking too much in the process.</p>
<h1 id="Playing-Casino-Games-Online-Keep-It-Fun-And-Safe"><a href="#Playing-Casino-Games-Online-Keep-It-Fun-And-Safe" class="headerlink" title="Playing Casino Games Online: Keep It Fun And Safe!"></a>Playing Casino Games Online: Keep It Fun And Safe!</h1><p>Casino games have been around for centuries, providing people with a fun and exciting way to gamble and hopefully win some money in the process. Today, casino games can be enjoyed from the comfort of one’s own home, with just a computer or mobile phone and an internet connection required. While this is certainly convenient, it also raises some safety concerns. So, how can you enjoy casino games online safely and responsibly?</p>
<p>One important thing to keep in mind when playing casino games online is that they should always be considered a form of entertainment. Never gamble more than you can afford to lose, and only gamble with money that you can afford to lose. Casino games are designed to be as addictive as possible, so it is easy to lose track of how much money you’re spending if you’re not careful. Set yourself a budget for gambling and stick to it!</p>
<p>Another important safety concern when playing casino games online is ensuring that you’re playing at a reputable site. There are many scam sites out there that will promise big wins but end up stealing your money instead. Do your research before choosing a site to play at and make sure that it is licensed and regulated by a reputable gaming authority.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure to keep your personal information safe when playing casino games online. Don’t share your login details with anyone else and never download any malware or viruses onto your computer while playing. If your computer does become infected, contact your antivirus provider for assistance immediately.</p>
<p>By following these simple tips, you can enjoy casino games online safely and responsibly!</p>

        <h1 id="Taxpayers-could-lose-out-on-6-billion-in-unclaimed-tax-benefits"><a href="#Taxpayers-could-lose-out-on-6-billion-in-unclaimed-tax-benefits" class="headerlink" title="Taxpayers could lose out on $6 billion in unclaimed tax benefits"></a>Taxpayers could lose out on $6 billion in unclaimed tax benefits</h1><p>A recent study found that American taxpayers could lose out on $6 billion in unclaimed tax benefits every year. This is largely due to the fact that many people are not aware of the various tax breaks and deductions available to them.</p>
<p>One of the biggest sources of unclaimed tax benefits is the home mortgage interest deduction. The majority of taxpayers who claim this deduction do not itemize their deductions, which means they are missing out on potential savings.</p>
<p>Other common tax breaks that go unused include the child tax credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. Many taxpayers do not realize that they are eligible for these credits, or they fail to claim them properly.</p>
<p>If you want to make sure that you are taking advantage of all of the available tax breaks, it is important to consult with a qualified accountant or tax preparer. They can help you determine which credits and deductions you qualify for, and help you file your taxes correctly.</p>
<p>If you haven’t filed your taxes yet, there’s still time to take advantage of some of these tax breaks. Contact a qualified accountant today to get started!</p>
<h1 id="1-6-billion-in-potential-tax-savings-goes-to-waste-each-year"><a href="#1-6-billion-in-potential-tax-savings-goes-to-waste-each-year" class="headerlink" title="$1.6 billion in potential tax savings goes to waste each year"></a>$1.6 billion in potential tax savings goes to waste each year</h1><p>It’s tax season, and as people across the country scramble to file their taxes, they likely don’t realize that $1.6 billion in potential tax savings goes to waste each year. That’s according to new research from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which finds that businesses and individuals could save billions of dollars by making better use of available technology.</p>
<p>“In general, people are unaware of the technology options that can help them save money on their taxes,” said NIST economist Stephen Maloney in a statement. “Our study found a lot of potential for savings by using existing technology in more effective ways.”</p>
<p>For example, businesses could save an estimated $1 billion each year by making better use of tax software and automating tax processes. Individuals could save an additional $600 million annually by taking similar measures.</p>
<p>Other areas where businesses and individuals could save money include:</p>
<p>-Using cloud computing services rather than on-premises IT infrastructure (savings of up to $700 million annually)<br>-Optimizing supply chains through improved forecasting and coordination (up to $350 million saved)<br>-Improving energy efficiency in buildings (up to $370 million saved)</p>
<p>While the potential savings identified in the NIST report are substantial, it’s important to note that they’re only estimates. In order to achieve these savings, taxpayers would need to adopt proven technological solutions that are already available today. So what’s stopping people from taking advantage of these cost-saving measures?</p>
<p>In some cases, it may be a lack of awareness about the options that are available. In other cases, it may be a reluctance to adopt new technologies or change long-standing processes. Whatever the reason, there’s no doubt that businesses and individuals could benefit from using technology more effectively when it comes to taxes.</p>
<h1 id="6-out-of-10-taxpayers-don’t-itemize-for-playing-losses-costing-them-big-time"><a href="#6-out-of-10-taxpayers-don’t-itemize-for-playing-losses-costing-them-big-time" class="headerlink" title="6 out of 10 taxpayers don’t itemize for playing losses, costing them big time"></a>6 out of 10 taxpayers don’t itemize for playing losses, costing them big time</h1><p>According to the [ National Taxpayers Union ] ( <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ntu.org/">https://www.ntu.org/</a> ) , nearly two-thirds of taxpayers don’t itemize their deductions, including those who could have deducted gambling losses in a given year. This costs taxpayers billions of dollars every year.</p>
<p>In fact, almost all of the $2 billion in gambling losses deducted by individual taxpayers in 2014 were claimed by people who didn’t itemize their deductions. That means that these folks gave up more than $1.6 billion in potential refunds by not taking this deduction.</p>
<p>If you’re one of the millions of Americans who don’t itemize your deductions, and you gambled last year, you may be missing out on a tax break. You can deduct your gambling losses if you itemize your deductions on your tax return . But, most people don’t bother to do this because they think it’s too complicated or they don’t think they’ll get a refund anyway.</p>
<p>It’s worth taking the time to learn about the deduction for gambling losses if you’re one of those people. The deduction can really add up if you’ve had a losing streak at the casino or racetrack.</p>
<p>Just how much can you claim as a deduction for gambling losses? In most cases, you can deduct your losses up to the amount of your winnings. So, if you won $1,000 but lost $2,000 gambling last year, you can claim a deduction for $1,000 .</p>
<p>This is an “above-the-line” deduction, which means that it reduces your taxable income directly. You don’t have to itemize your deductions to take advantage of it . And, if you’re subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), this deduction will still lower your tax bill .</p>
<h1 id="Missing-out-on-valuable-tax-breaks-the-cost-of-not-itemizing-your-deductions"><a href="#Missing-out-on-valuable-tax-breaks-the-cost-of-not-itemizing-your-deductions" class="headerlink" title="Missing out on valuable tax breaks: the cost of not itemizing your deductions"></a>Missing out on valuable tax breaks: the cost of not itemizing your deductions</h1><p>There are a lot of compelling reasons to itemize your deductions on your tax return: you can lower your taxable income, reduce your overall tax bill, and sometimes receive valuable tax breaks. However, there are also some compelling reasons not to itemize: it can be time consuming and complex, and if you don’t qualify for many itemized deductions, it may not be worth your time.</p>
<p>Despite these factors, millions of taxpayers still choose to itemize their deductions each year. In fact, in 2016 nearly 30 million taxpayers (roughly one-third of all filers) chose to itemize their deductions. So what makes itemizing such a popular choice?</p>
<p>For many taxpayers, the main benefit of itemizing is that it allows them to deduct certain expenses that they wouldn’t be able to deduct if they took the standard deduction. Some of the most common itemized deductions include mortgage interest, property taxes, charitable donations, and state and local income taxes.</p>
<p>These deductions can add up quickly and can help reduce your taxable income significantly. For example, if you have a mortgage with a $10,000 interest payment, a $5,000 property tax bill, and make $1,000 in charitable donations, you would have a total of $16,000 in itemized deductions. This would lower your taxable income by $16,000, resulting in a tax savings of several thousand dollars.</p>
<p>In addition to the above items, there are a number of other valuable tax breaks that can be claimed through itemization. These include the write-off for unreimbursed employee expenses, the home office deduction, the student loan interest deduction and more. And while not everyone will qualify for all of these deductions, those who do can save a significant amount of money on their taxes.</p>
<p>So why would someone choose not to itemize? The main reason is that if you don’t qualify for many itemized deductions, it may not be worth your time. The standard deduction is much simpler to claim than itemizing and is available to all taxpayers regardless of their income or filing status. In 2016 the standard deduction was $6,300 for single taxpayers and $12,600 for married couples filing jointly.</p>
<p>This may seem like a small amount compared to the potential savings from itemizing your deductions; but if your total miscellaneous expenses (such as unreimbursed employee expenses mentioned earlier) are less than $6,300 (for single taxpayers) or $12,600 (for married couples), then it would be more advantageous to take the standard deduction rather than bother with itemizing.</p>
<h1 id="Why-you-should-always-itemize-your-deductions-even-if-you-have-playing-losses"><a href="#Why-you-should-always-itemize-your-deductions-even-if-you-have-playing-losses" class="headerlink" title="Why you should always itemize your deductions, even if you have playing losses"></a>Why you should always itemize your deductions, even if you have playing losses</h1><p>Are you someone who engages in a lot of gambling activities throughout the year? If so, there’s a good chance that you’re taking the standard deduction when you file your taxes. But if you have losses from gambling, you may be wondering if it makes sense to itemize your deductions after all.</p>
<p>The answer is, unequivocally, yes. Even though your gambling losses may seem like they wipe out any potential benefit of itemizing, it’s still worth doing so because of all of the other deductions you could be eligible for.</p>
<p>For starters, there’s the mortgage interest deduction. If you own a home, chances are you pay a lot of interest on your mortgage every year. By itemizing your deductions, you can shave a significant amount off of your taxable income.</p>
<p>There are also many other deductions that could save you money on your taxes, such as those for charitable contributions and medical expenses. Of course, these deductions vary from person to person depending on their individual circumstances, so it’s important to talk to a tax professional to see if itemizing is right for you.</p>
<p>But even if some of your potential deductions aren’t as large as the ones mentioned above, it’s still worth taking the time to itemize them. After all, every little bit counts when it comes to reducing your taxable income.</p>
<p>So if you have any gambling losses from this year or in years past, don’t forget to include them when you file your taxes. It may not seem like it’s worth the hassle at first glance, but trust us – it is!</p>

        <h1 id="Speed-Baccarat-13-legal-in-Missouri"><a href="#Speed-Baccarat-13-legal-in-Missouri" class="headerlink" title="Speed Baccarat 13 legal in Missouri!"></a>Speed Baccarat 13 legal in Missouri!</h1><p>Thousands of people in Missouri are playing Speed Baccarat 13 legal right now! The game, which is similar to the traditional baccarat game, is played with six decks of cards and allows players to bet on either the player or banker hands.</p>
<p>What makes Speed Baccarat 13 so popular is that it is a fast-paced game that offers excitement and thrills. In addition, there are many ways to bet, making the game more challenging and exciting. Another great thing about Speed Baccarat 13 is that it’s legal in Missouri! So whether you’re looking for a new casino game to play or just want to experience some excitement and thrills, be sure to check out Speed Baccarat 13 at your local casino!</p>
<h1 id="Speed-Baccarat-13-legal-only-at-select-casinos"><a href="#Speed-Baccarat-13-legal-only-at-select-casinos" class="headerlink" title="Speed Baccarat 13 legal only at select casinos!"></a>Speed Baccarat 13 legal only at select casinos!</h1><p>Speed Baccarat is one of the latest versions of this classic casino game and can now only be played legally at a handful of casinos around the world. The game is played with six decks of cards, which are shuffled together and placed in the shoe. The player then bets on either the Banker or the Player. After all bets have been placed, the first card is dealt face up to the Banker and the second card is dealt face up to the Player. If either of these cards is an Ace, it is counted as 1 point. The rest of the cards are counted at their face value. If the total points are 8 or 9, this is called a natural and no further cards are drawn. If the total points are anything else, both players draw one more card each and the highest point total between them wins (unless one has a natural – in which case they automatically win).</p>
<p>The beauty of Speed Baccarat is that it moves quickly – hence the name! – so you can get through more hands per hour than you would in traditional baccarat. This makes it an appealing option for players who want to get stuck into a game without spending too much time on each hand. It’s also great for those who like to keep things exciting by playing multiple hands simultaneously!</p>
<p>Whilst Speed Baccarat can be enjoyed at a few select casinos, it’s not available at all gaming venues so be sure to head to one of our recommended sites if you want to try your luck.</p>

<h1 id="Missouri-gambling-laws-for-Speed-Baccarat-13"><a href="#Missouri-gambling-laws-for-Speed-Baccarat-13" class="headerlink" title="Missouri gambling laws for Speed Baccarat 13!"></a>Missouri gambling laws for Speed Baccarat 13!</h1><p>In Missouri, the only type of gambling allowed at casinos is slots and video poker. However, there are some specific laws that apply to one game in particular-speed baccarat.</p>
<p>First and foremost, casinos are not allowed to offer side bets on the game of speed baccarat. This means that players cannot place bets on whether the banker or player will win, or any other proposition bets. In addition, players are not allowed to keep track of their own cards in order to gain an advantage over the house.</p>
<p>If a player is caught violating any of these rules, they can be subject to criminal prosecution. In fact, several Missouri casinos have gotten in trouble with the law for allowing players to break these rules. So if you’re thinking about playing speed baccarat in Missouri, make sure you know and obey the rules!</p>
<h1 id="Get-the-scoop-on-playing-Speed-Baccarat-13-in-Missouri"><a href="#Get-the-scoop-on-playing-Speed-Baccarat-13-in-Missouri" class="headerlink" title="Get the scoop on playing Speed Baccarat 13 in Missouri!"></a>Get the scoop on playing Speed Baccarat 13 in Missouri!</h1><p>An increasing number of casino players are discovering the thrills and excitement of playing Speed Baccarat 13. For those who are not yet familiar with this variant, it is essentially the same as traditional baccarat with a few twists that make the game faster and more exciting. If you are interested in playing Speed Baccarat 13 in Missouri, be sure to read on for all the important information you need to know.</p>
<p>One big difference between traditional baccarat and Speed Baccarat 13 is that in the latter variant, players only have three possible bets to choose from – banker, player, or tie. This makes the game much faster since there is no need to wait for each player to make a decision on their bet. Furthermore, the banker and player bets pay out at even money instead of odds of 1:1, making the game even more exciting.</p>
<p>Another difference between traditional baccarat and Speed Baccarat 13 is that the former typically uses six decks of cards while the latter uses just one deck. This means that there is less opportunity for players to benefit from card counting strategies in Speed Baccarat 13. However, it also makes the game much faster and more exciting since players don’t have to wait long for new cards to be dealt.</p>
<p>If you are looking for an exciting alternative to traditional baccarat, then Speed Baccarat 13 is definitely worth checking out. In addition to being fast-paced and exciting, this variant also offers relatively good odds compared to other casino games. So what are you waiting for?

        <h1 id="Juventus-FC-fined-for-violating-California-gambling-laws"><a href="#Juventus-FC-fined-for-violating-California-gambling-laws" class="headerlink" title="Juventus FC fined for violating California gambling laws"></a>Juventus FC fined for violating California gambling laws</h1><p>Juventus FC was recently fined by the California Gambling Control Commission for violating state gambling laws. The Italian soccer club was fined $2 million for illegally promoting and operating a gambling business in the state.</p>
<p>The commission’s investigation found that Juventus had been promoting and operating an illegal gambling business through its official website and social media accounts. The club was also found to have been offering free bets and other promotional incentives to lure customers into betting on its website.</p>
<p>In addition to the $2 million fine, Juventus has been ordered to shut down its illegal gambling operation and pay costs related to the investigation. The club has also agreed to cooperate with the commission in future investigations into illegal gambling activity.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Juventus has been fined for violating gambling laws. In 2017, the club was fined $3 million for similar violations.</p>
<h1 id="Juventus-FC-officials-charged-with-violating-California-gambling-laws"><a href="#Juventus-FC-officials-charged-with-violating-California-gambling-laws" class="headerlink" title="Juventus FC officials charged with violating California gambling laws"></a>Juventus FC officials charged with violating California gambling laws</h1><p>On Wednesday, March 13, 2019, officials from Juventus Football Club (Juventus FC), an Italian professional football club based in Turin, were charged with violating California gambling laws. The charges come after a months-long investigation by the California Attorney General’s office into allegations that Juventus officials engaged in illegal gambling activities.</p>
<p>Specifically, the charges allege that Juventus FC officials placed bets on U.S. collegiate and professional sports matches, including games played in California. California law prohibits betting on any amateur or professional sporting event taking place within the state.</p>
<p>Two of the club’s top executives, general manager Giuseppe Marotta and vice president Pavel Nedved, have been named in the indictment. Both men are accused of arranging and placing bets worth millions of dollars on behalf of Juventus FC. In a statement released following the charges being announced, Juventus FC condemned the actions of its employees, stating that they do not represent the values of the club.</p>
<p>The charges against Juventus FC come as part of a broader crackdown by the California Attorney General’s office on illegal gambling activity. In February 2019, the office announced a $25 million settlement with one of the largest online gambling companies in the world, PokerStars. The settlement stemmed from allegations that PokerStars had illegally taken bets from Californians over a period of several years.</p>
<h1 id="Juventus-FC-to-face-trial-for-violating-California-gambling-laws"><a href="#Juventus-FC-to-face-trial-for-violating-California-gambling-laws" class="headerlink" title="Juventus FC to face trial for violating California gambling laws"></a>Juventus FC to face trial for violating California gambling laws</h1><p>The Italian football club Juventus FC is to face trial for violating California gambling laws. The case is to be heard in a US District Court in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege that the club and its then-president, Antonio Conte, conspired to hide millions of dollars in payments from the US tax authorities. The payments were made to Conte and other Juventus staff in exchange for their help in influencing referees during matches.</p>
<p>Investigators believe that this conspiracy led to Juve winning several matches they would otherwise have lost, which boosted the team’s chances of winning the 2004–05 Serie A championship. As a result, prosecutors argue that the club and Conte should be held criminally liable for violating American gambling laws.</p>
<p>Juventus has denied all charges, stating that the payments were made purely for footballing reasons. They maintain that they did nothing wrong and are confident that they will be cleared of any wrongdoing when the case goes to trial later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Juventus-FC-casino-raided-amid-allegations-of-violating-California-gambling-laws"><a href="#Juventus-FC-casino-raided-amid-allegations-of-violating-California-gambling-laws" class="headerlink" title="Juventus FC casino raided amid allegations of violating California gambling laws"></a>Juventus FC casino raided amid allegations of violating California gambling laws</h1><p>As the world of professional football mourns the premature passing of Juventus FC captain and legendary striker, Andrea Pirlo, a dark cloud has descended over the club in the form of a casino raid.</p>
<p>Local law enforcement officials allege that Juventus FC casino, located in the heart of the city of Turin, has been violating California gambling laws. As a result, police have seized numerous gambling devices and arrested several casino employees.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Juventus FC has been embroiled in a major controversy. In 2015, the club was caught up in a match-fixing scandal that saw several high-ranking officials indicted on criminal charges. However, this latest incident may be even more damaging to the club’s reputation.</p>
<p>Fans and pundits are already questioning how such a thing could happen under the watch of new manager Massimiliano Allegri. Allegri replaced former manager Antonio Conte after he left to take charge of the Italian national team.</p>
<p>It is still too early to tell what impact this latest incident will have on Juventus FC, but one thing is for sure: it is another black eye for one of Europe’s most storied clubs.</p>
<h1 id="Juventus-FC-denies-any-wrongdoing-in-relation-to-California-gambling-laws"><a href="#Juventus-FC-denies-any-wrongdoing-in-relation-to-California-gambling-laws" class="headerlink" title="Juventus FC denies any wrongdoing in relation to California gambling laws"></a>Juventus FC denies any wrongdoing in relation to California gambling laws</h1><p>In a statement released earlier this week, Juventus FC has announced that it denies any wrongdoing in relation to California gambling laws. The announcement comes in response to reports from the Italian media that the club is being investigated by the United States’ Department of Justice for suspected involvement in illegal gambling operations.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Juventus FC told reporters that the club is cooperating with the authorities in their investigation, but denies any wrongdoing. The spokesperson also stated that Juventus FC has a “zero tolerance policy” when it comes to matches being fixed and would take disciplinary action against any player found guilty of involvement in such activities.</p>
<p>The allegations against Juventus FC come as part of a wider investigation into illegal gambling operations which have been linked to several professional football clubs around the world. So far, investigations have been conducted in Italy, Spain, and Germany, with more than 60 people being arrested as part of the crackdown.</p>
<p>One of the main suspects in the investigations is believed to be Rene McKay, a British national who is alleged to be at the head of an international gambling ring. McKay is said to have links to several football clubs, including AC Milan and Real Madrid, as well as several Asian casinos.</p>
<p>So far, there is no evidence that Juventus FC has been involved in any illegal activity beyond its alleged connection to McKay. However, if found guilty, the club could face sanctions from both U.S. and Italian authorities.</p>

        <h1 id="Online-Gambling-for-Sports-Fans-is-Now-Available"><a href="#Online-Gambling-for-Sports-Fans-is-Now-Available" class="headerlink" title="Online Gambling for Sports Fans is Now Available"></a>Online Gambling for Sports Fans is Now Available</h1><p>The sporting world is abuzz with upcoming events that fans from around the globe are preparing to watch. Major League Baseball is in full swing, the National Football League is gearing up for its preseason, and international soccer tournaments are just around the corner. While spectators traditionally flock to stadiums or their home TVs to take in all the action, this year they can also engage in some online gambling sports action of their own.</p>
<p>Thanks to a proliferation of online gambling sites, fans can now place bets on games ranging from professional sports like the NFL and English Premier League soccer to collegiate contests and even Little League baseball matchups. And while wagering on sports is nothing new, the ease and convenience of betting online has made the experience more popular than ever before.</p>
<p>For those who love the thrill of gambling but don’t live near a casino or racetrack, online sports betting can be a godsend. Not only can players place bets on major league games from anywhere in the world, but many sites also offer streaming video of contests as they’re happening. This allows fans to make informed decisions about their bets while enjoying all the excitement of watching the game live.</p>
<p>So whether you’re a fan of American football or international soccer, there’s no need to miss out on the action just because you’re not near a TV or stadium. Online gambling for sports fans has never been easier – or more fun!</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Betting-is-the-New-Way-to-Gamble"><a href="#Sports-Betting-is-the-New-Way-to-Gamble" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting is the New Way to Gamble"></a>Sports Betting is the New Way to Gamble</h1><p>The popularity of online sports betting is on the rise. People from all over the world are logging in to their favorite sports betting websites in order to place a wager on their favorite team or player. In many ways, sports betting has become the new way to gamble.</p>
<p>Unlike casino games such as blackjack or roulette, where your fate is largely determined by chance, sports betting allows you to use your knowledge and expertise to make informed decisions. This makes it a more rewarding experience for many people, as they feel like they are in control of their own destiny.</p>
<p>Another reason why sports betting has become so popular is because of the sheer variety of markets available. You can bet on pretty much any sport that takes your fancy, from mainstream sports like football and basketball, to more niche sports such as darts and rugby. This gives you the opportunity to find markets that you are familiar with, and increase your chances of winning money.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind when gambling on sports is that it is important to do your research first. Don’t just bet on your favorite team without knowing anything about the other team. Study the statistics, read news articles, and talk to experts in order to get an edge over the competition.</p>
<p>Sports betting can be a lot of fun, but it is also important to remember that it is a form of gambling and should be treated as such. Never bet more than you can afford to lose, and always make sure that you have a solid gambling plan in place. If you do these things, then you should enjoy a successful experience when betting on sports online.</p>
<h1 id="Watch-Out-Vegas-Online-Sports-Gambling-is-on-the-Rise"><a href="#Watch-Out-Vegas-Online-Sports-Gambling-is-on-the-Rise" class="headerlink" title="Watch Out, Vegas - Online Sports Gambling is on the Rise!"></a>Watch Out, Vegas - Online Sports Gambling is on the Rise!</h1><p>Las Vegas has been the go-to destination for all things gambling for many years. But it seems that online sports gambling is on the rise, and threatening to take over as the favorite pastime of gamblers. So what is behind this trend, and why should Vegas be worried?</p>
<p>There are a few factors driving this shift in preference for online sports gambling. For one thing, it is now much easier and more convenient to gamble online than it is to travel to Las Vegas. Secondly, the variety and quality of online sports gambling options continues to improve, making it a more attractive option for those looking to bet on sports. And finally, the legalization of online gambling in certain jurisdictions has helped fuel its growth.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for Las Vegas? Well, it’s not all bad news for the city.Nevada still dominates when it comes to casino gambling revenue, and there is no indication that this will change any time soon. However, with the growth of online sports gambling, casinos in Las Vegas may find themselves competing with online operators for a piece of the pie. This could lead to decreased profits and even closures of some casinos in the city.</p>
<p>All in all, the rise of online sports gambling is proving to be a major challenge for Las Vegas. The city will need to work hard to stay ahead of the curve and maintain its status as the top destination for gamblers around the world.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Gamblers-are-Taking-Over-the-Internet"><a href="#Sports-Gamblers-are-Taking-Over-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="Sports Gamblers are Taking Over the Internet"></a>Sports Gamblers are Taking Over the Internet</h1><p>In the last decade, sports gambling has exploded in popularity. This is thanks in part to the internet, which has made placing bets easier than ever before. Nowadays, it seems like everyone is betting on sports.</p>
<p>Of course, not all gamblers are successful. In fact, the vast majority of people who place bets lose money in the long run. But that doesn’t seem to stop people from betting on sports.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this exploding popularity of sports gambling. For one thing, sports are inherently exciting and unpredictable. This makes them perfect for gambling purposes. Additionally, the internet has made it possible to bet on sports games from anywhere in the world. This has opened up the market to a much wider audience than ever before.</p>
<p>The popularity of sports gambling has created a large number of online casinos and sports betting websites. These websites offer a wide variety of betting options, making it easy for customers to find what they are looking for. In addition, these websites often offer bonuses and other promotional offers in order to attract new customers.</p>
<p>Sports gambling can be a lot of fun, but it is also important to remember that it is a risky business. If you are not careful, you can easily lose your hard-earned money by gambling on sports games. So make sure that you only gamble with money that you can afford to lose.</p>

The US Supreme Court recently overturned a federal law that outlawed sports gambling, which leaves the door open for states to legalize it within their own borders. If you’re thinking of getting into sports gambling, here are some things you need to know first.</p>
<h1 id="The-State-of-Gambling-in-the-US"><a href="#The-State-of-Gambling-in-the-US" class="headerlink" title="The State of Gambling in the US"></a>The State of Gambling in the US</h1><p>Gambling is legal in some form in most states, but the specifics vary greatly. Some states have tribal casinos, while others have state-run lotteries. There are also many states where betting on horse races is legal. Sports gambling is a bit more complicated, as it was not specifically legalized by most states. However, the recent Supreme Court ruling opens the door for states to pass laws legalizing it, and a few have already done so.</p>
<h1 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Sports-Gambling"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Sports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Sports Gambling"></a>Pros and Cons of Sports Gambling</h1><p>Like any other form of gambling, there are pros and cons to sports gambling.

On the con side, there is always the risk of losing money, especially if you bet on games that are difficult to predict. There is also the risk of becoming addicted to gambling if you’re not careful.</p>

Gambling addiction can lead to financial ruin, family conflict, and job loss. It is time for gambling to be recognized as the serious addiction that it is, and for it to be made illegal in all its forms.</p>
<p>Gambling addictions are among the most difficult addictions to overcome. They can lead people to do things they would never ordinarily do, like stealing money from loved ones or friends in order to gamble with it. Gambling addicts often become so obsessed with winning that they will continue to gamble even when they are losing money hand over fist. This can lead to serious financial problems and even bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction also has a serious impact on families. Family members of gamblers often feel neglected and ignored as the addict focuses all of his or her attention on gambling. Conflict within families is common as loved ones argue about money that has been gambled away or about how best to help the addict break free from the addiction.</p>
<p>Job loss is another common consequence of gambling addiction. Many addicts lose their jobs due to their habit, and some even go so far as to commit fraud in order to get money to gamble with. These consequences have a ripple effect throughout society, as families are torn apart and careers are destroyed.</p>
<p>It is time for gambling addiction to be taken seriously. This destructive behaviour should not be allowed to ruin lives any longer. Gambling should be made illegal in all its forms, so that those who are addicted have no way of accessing this dangerous substance.</p>
<h1 id="Psychologists-say-gambling-addiction-is-a-real-thing-–-we-should-outlaw-it"><a href="#Psychologists-say-gambling-addiction-is-a-real-thing-–-we-should-outlaw-it" class="headerlink" title="Psychologists say gambling addiction is a real thing – we should outlaw it!"></a>Psychologists say gambling addiction is a real thing – we should outlaw it!</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a problem that is often downplayed and not taken seriously by many people. However, psychologists say that gambling addiction is very real, and it should be outlawed in order to protect people from its harmful effects.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have a devastating impact on people’s lives. It can lead to financial problems, relationship issues, and even job loss. Additionally, gambling addiction can also be very dangerous, as it can lead to alcohol or drug abuse as people try to cope with their addiction.</p>
<p>Given the serious risks associated with gambling addiction, it is clear that something should be done about it. Psychologists say that the best way to deal with this problem is to outlaw gambling altogether. This would help to prevent people from becoming addicted to gambling and would also help those who are already struggling with this addiction from getting the help they need.</p>
<p>There are some who might argue that outlawing gambling would be too harsh of a measure. However, the risks associated with gambling addiction are simply too great for us to ignore. We need to take action now in order to protect people from the harm that gambling can cause.</p>
<h1 id="More-evidence-shows-how-gambling-destroys-lives-–-it’s-time-to-make-it-illegal"><a href="#More-evidence-shows-how-gambling-destroys-lives-–-it’s-time-to-make-it-illegal" class="headerlink" title="More evidence shows how gambling destroys lives – it’s time to make it illegal!"></a>More evidence shows how gambling destroys lives – it’s time to make it illegal!</h1><p>There’s no doubt that gambling destroys lives. The evidence is all there, piling up higher and higher every day. So why hasn’t it been made illegal yet?</p>
<p>One answer might be the amount of money that the gambling industry pumps into politics. But whatever the reason, it’s time for something to be done about it.</p>
<p>In Australia, for example, it’s estimated that around 180,000 people areproblem gamblers, and a further 2 million are at risk of developing a problem. That’s not to mention the family members and friends who are affected by their loved ones’ gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have all sorts of devastating effects on people’s lives. It can lead to financial problems, relationship breakdowns, job losses, and even suicide. In fact, suicide rates among problem gamblers are six times higher than the general population.</p>
<p>Clearly, gambling is doing enormous harm to our society, and something needs to be done about it. The sooner we make gambling illegal, the better.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-causes-crime-–-let’s-make-it-illegal-and-protect-our-communities"><a href="#Gambling-causes-crime-–-let’s-make-it-illegal-and-protect-our-communities" class="headerlink" title="Gambling causes crime – let’s make it illegal and protect our communities!"></a>Gambling causes crime – let’s make it illegal and protect our communities!</h1><p>The social ills of gambling are well-documented. Gambling causes crime, family breakdown, bankruptcy, and addiction. It is a known gateway to other forms of criminal activity. So why is it legal?</p>
<p>There is no justification for making gambling legal when its negative consequences are so abundantly clear. We should be protecting our communities by making gambling illegal. Let’s make it happen!</p>
<h1 id="It’s-time-to-stand-up-against-big-casinos-and-protect-the-people-–-gambling-should-be-illegal"><a href="#It’s-time-to-stand-up-against-big-casinos-and-protect-the-people-–-gambling-should-be-illegal" class="headerlink" title="It’s time to stand up against big casinos and protect the people – gambling should be illegal!"></a>It’s time to stand up against big casinos and protect the people – gambling should be illegal!</h1><p>In the early days of America, gambling was seen as a vice that threatened the moral fabric of society. This is why gambling was made illegal in many states.</p>
<p>Now, big casinos are threatening the livelihoods of everyday Americans. Casinos are sucking money out of our local economies and lining the pockets of billionaires.</p>
<p>It’s time to stand up against big casinos and protect the people. Gambling should be illegal!</p>
