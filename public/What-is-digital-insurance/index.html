        <h1 id="What-is-digital-insurance"><a href="#What-is-digital-insurance" class="headerlink" title="What is digital insurance?"></a>What is digital insurance?</h1><p>Digital insurance is a term used to describe the transfer of risk from an individual or organization to an insurer using digital technology. The purpose of digital insurance is to protect individuals and organizations from financial losses that may result from data breaches, cybercrime and other risks posed by technology.</p>
<p>The use of digital technology has made it easier for insurers to assess risk and offer insurance products to individuals and organizations. It has also made it easier for individuals and organizations to purchase insurance products online.</p>
<p>Insurers are offering a variety of digital insurance products, including cyber liability insurance, data breach insurance, and ransomware protection.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-digital-insurance-work"><a href="#How-does-digital-insurance-work" class="headerlink" title="How does digital insurance work?"></a>How does digital insurance work?</h1><p>Digital insurance works by transferring the risk of data breaches, cybercrime, and other risks posed by technology to an insurer. The insurer then uses its expertise in risk assessment and underwriting to offer a product that protects the individual or organization from financial losses.</p>
<p>In many cases, the purchase of digital insurance can be completed online in a matter of minutes. This makes it easy for individuals and organizations to protect themselves against the risks posed by technology.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-having-digital-insurance-for-your-online-business"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-having-digital-insurance-for-your-online-business" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of having digital insurance for your online business?"></a>What are the benefits of having digital insurance for your online business?</h1><p>As a business owner, you know that you need to protect your interests by having insurance. But what about your online business? Do you have digital insurance for that?</p>
<p>Just as with any other type of business, your online venture needs protection from possible liability and damages. This is where digital insurance comes in.</p>
<p>There are many benefits of having this type of coverage for your online business: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Protection from data breaches - One of the biggest dangers to any business is a data breach. If your customer information or proprietary data is accessed by unauthorized individuals, you could face serious legal and financial consequences. Digital insurance can help protect you from these risks by providing coverage for damages resulting from a data breach. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Coverage for viruses and other malware - Hackers are constantly coming up with new ways to attack businesses online. They may use viruses or malware to gain access to your systems, causing damage or theft of information. Digital insurance can help pay for the costs of repairing or replacing affected equipment as well as the cost of recovering lost data. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Coverage for intellectual property disputes - Sometimes businesses engage in disputes over intellectual property rights. If these disagreements end up in court, the legal fees can be expensive. Digital insurance can help cover some of the costs associated with defending your intellectual property rights. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Protection from hacking and cybercrime - As noted earlier, hackers are always coming up with new ways to attack businesses online. They may try to steal customer information or financial data, or simply vandalize your website. Digital insurance can help pay for the costs associated with repairing the damage done by hackers as well as the expense of hiring a security consultant to help improve your security system. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Coverage for business interruption - If your online business is attacked and forced to shut down, you could lose income while it is out of operation. Digital insurance can provide coverage for lost revenue due to an interruption in business operations caused by a covered event. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Extra peace of mind - In addition to all these practical benefits, digital insurance also provides peace of mind knowing that you are protected against many risks faced by online businesses. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, there are many good reasons to have digital insurance for your online business. Contact an insurance broker today to learn more about this type of coverage and how it can help protect your venture</p>
<h1 id="How-much-does-digital-insurance-cost"><a href="#How-much-does-digital-insurance-cost" class="headerlink" title="How much does digital insurance cost?"></a>How much does digital insurance cost?</h1><p>Digital insurance, also known as cyber insurance, is a type of insurance policy that covers businesses and individuals against losses incurred from a data breach. It is a relatively new product, having been created in the early 2000s in response to the growing number of cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Despite its recent origins, digital insurance has become increasingly popular and can be found in most major markets around the world. In the United States, for example, cyber insurance premiums totaled $1.3 billion in 2016 and are expected to grow by 10% annually through 2020.</p>
<p>So what factors influence the cost of digital insurance? And how can you save money on your policy?</p>
<p>The cost of digital insurance policies varies depending on a number of factors, including the size of the company, its industry, and the type and amount of coverage selected. However, there are some general guidelines that can help you understand how much your policy will cost.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, small businesses can expect to pay between $500 and $5,000 for a year’s worth of coverage, while larger companies can expect to pay more than $100,000 per year. However, these numbers are just averages and prices may vary significantly depending on the insurer.</p>
<p>Another important factor that affects price is whether or not you have suffered a data breach in the past. If you have had a breach in the past, your premium will be higher than if you have not had one. This is because insurers see companies that have had breaches as being more risky and therefore charge them more for coverage.</p>
<p>There are also a number of ways that businesses can save money on their digital insurance policies. The most important way to save money is to shop around for the best deal. There are a number of different insurers offering cyber insurance policies, so it is important to compare rates before selecting a policy.</p>
<p>Businesses can also save money by increasing their deductible amount. The deductible is the amount that the business must pay out-of-pocket before the insurer begins paying claims. By increasing the deductible amount, businesses can reduce their premiums costs.</p>
<p>Finally, businesses can save money by selecting a policy that covers only specific risks rather than all risks associated with data breaches. For example, a business might choose to only cover losses resulting from ransomware attacks or stolen laptops rather than all possible risks. This allows businesses to tailor their policies to their specific needs and reduces their premiums costs.</p>

Once you have found one, they will help you review your existing policies and see if there is anything that needs to be updated or added.</p>
<p>The next step is to identify what type of coverage you need. Your agent will help you navigate this process by asking a series of questions about your business. Some of the factors that will be considered include the number of employees, the type of products or services offered, and the company’s annual revenue.</p>
<p>Once the type of coverage has been identified, the agent will help you find a policy that meets your needs. This may include property damage insurance, product liability insurance, and cyber liability insurance.</p>

<h1 id="What-are-the-exclusions-of-coverage-with-digital-insurance"><a href="#What-are-the-exclusions-of-coverage-with-digital-insurance" class="headerlink" title="What are the exclusions of coverage with digital insurance?"></a>What are the exclusions of coverage with digital insurance?</h1><p>As with any type of insurance policy, there are exclusions of coverage. This is also true with digital insurance policies. There are certain items that are not covered under a digital insurance policy.</p>
<p>One exclusion of coverage is damage to electronic media that is not related to a specific peril like fire or water damage. So, for example, if your computer is damaged as a result of a power surge, that would be covered by your digital insurance policy. However, if your computer is damaged as a result of a virus or other type of malware, that would not be covered.</p>
<p>Another exclusion of coverage with digital insurance policies is the theft of electronic equipment that is not connected to a specific peril. For example, if someone steals your laptop from your home, that would be covered by your digital insurance policy. However, if someone steals your smartphone from your purse, that would not be covered.</p>
<p>There are also certain perils that are specifically excluded from coverage under digital insurance policies. These include hacking and cybercrime, data loss or corruption, and failure of electronic equipment.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand the exclusions of coverage when you are considering purchasing a digital insurance policy. Make sure you are aware of what is and isn’t covered so you can make an informed decision about whether this type of coverage is right for you.</p>
