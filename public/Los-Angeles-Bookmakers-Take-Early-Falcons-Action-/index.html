        <h1 id="Los-Angeles-Bookmakers-Take-Early-Falcons-Action"><a href="#Los-Angeles-Bookmakers-Take-Early-Falcons-Action" class="headerlink" title="Los Angeles Bookmakers Take Early Falcons Action"></a>Los Angeles Bookmakers Take Early Falcons Action</h1><p>In anticipation of the Atlanta Falcons’ first Super Bowl appearance in nearly two decades, a number of Las Vegas bookmakers have taken an early action on the team to win.</p>
<p>At the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook, the Falcons opened as 3-point favorites against the New England Patriots, and they have attracted 71 percent of the bets so far. The Wynn has also taken an early majority of Falcons bets, with 72 percent at sportsbooks monitored by ESPN.</p>
<p>The last time the Falcons were in the Super Bowl, they were 14-point underdogs to the Denver Broncos in 1998. This year, they are hoping to bring home the Vince Lombardi Trophy for the first time in franchise history.</p>
<p>The Patriots are no strangers to championship games, having won five of their previous seven appearances. However, many observers believe that Atlanta’s high-powered offense will be too much for New England to handle.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about betting on the Falcons, it is important to do your homework first. Make sure you understand how well Matt Ryan and Julio Jones have been playing this season, as well as how well Tom Brady has been able to lead his team through adversity.</p>
<p>Also be sure to check out any injury news before placing your bet. If any key players are banged up, it could affect the outcome of the game.</p>
<h1 id="Atlanta-Falcons-the-Biggest-Losers-at-the-Las-Vegas-Betting-Table"><a href="#Atlanta-Falcons-the-Biggest-Losers-at-the-Las-Vegas-Betting-Table" class="headerlink" title="Atlanta Falcons the Biggest Losers at the Las Vegas Betting Table"></a>Atlanta Falcons the Biggest Losers at the Las Vegas Betting Table</h1><p>The Atlanta Falcons, who were Super Bowl losers against the New England Patriots in 2017, have to be considered the biggest losers at the Las Vegas betting table this offseason.</p>
<p>As of this writing, Atlanta’s odds of winning the Super Bowl in 2019 are 25-1, behind only six other teams. In contrast, the Patriots’ odds are 5-1, making them one of the favorites to win it all.</p>
<p>It’s not just the Super Bowl that the Falcons are at a disadvantage for. They also rank in the bottom half of the league in terms of odds to win their division (14-1) and conference (10-1).</p>
<p>There are a few factors that could be contributing to these lopsided odds. One is that quarterback Matt Ryan is coming off a down year by his standards. His passer rating of 97.4 was still good enough for seventh in the league, but it was well below his 114.5 rating from 2016—the year he was named MVP.</p>
<p>Another reason that Atlanta may be facing long odds is that they had to make a lot of changes this offseason. They lost longtime defensive coordinator Richard Smith and three starters on that side of the ball (Dontari Poe, Adrian Clayborn, and Deion Jones). In addition, they let receiver Taylor Gabriel and running back Tevin Coleman leave via free agency.</p>
<p>Those departures could lead to regression on offense, which was already relatively inefficient last season (they ranked 17th in offensive DVOA). And with no significant additions made to bolster either unit, there’s good reason to believe that things could get worse before they get better in Atlanta.</p>
<h1 id="Odds-Shifting-in-Favor-of-Rams-Ahead-of-Showdown-with-Falcons"><a href="#Odds-Shifting-in-Favor-of-Rams-Ahead-of-Showdown-with-Falcons" class="headerlink" title="Odds Shifting in Favor of Rams Ahead of Showdown with Falcons"></a>Odds Shifting in Favor of Rams Ahead of Showdown with Falcons</h1><p>In a matchup of two teams that both started the season as Super Bowl contenders, the Los Angeles Rams will host the Atlanta Falcons this coming Sunday. The Rams were impressive in their Week 1 win over the Oakland Raiders, while the Falcons looked shaky in their loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>This game is already starting to feel like a battle for NFC supremacy, with the Rams and Falcons both gunning for first place in their division. With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at how these two teams are shaping up ahead of their showdown at the Coliseum.</p>
<p>For the Rams, things are looking good on both sides of the ball. quarterback Jared Goff had an efficient outing in Week 1, completing 18 of 33 passes for 233 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also looks to have developed a strong chemistry with new wide receiver Brandin Cooks, who hauled in 5 receptions for 87 yards and a touchdown against Oakland.</p>
<p>The defense was also impressive against Oakland, holding Derek Carr and the Raiders offense to just 10 points scored. Defensive end Aaron Donald continued his dominant play, recording 3 sacks and 4 tackles for loss. If Donald can keep up this level of play, he could very well be in line for another defensive player of the year award.</p>
<p>The Falcons, meanwhile, are coming into this game with some concerns on both sides of the ball. In Week 1, quarterback Matt Ryan struggled mightily, completing just 23 of 34 passes for 301 yards, 2 touchdowns and an interception. Wide receiver Julio Jones also had a down game, catching just 5 passes for 62 yards.</p>
<p>The defense didn’t fare much better against Philadelphia, allowing Carson Wentz and company to put up 27 points scored. Linebackers Deion Jones and Vic Beasley Jr., who were two of Atlanta’s top defensive players last season, both had poor games statistically. If these two can get back on track this week, it would go a long way towards helping Atlanta win on the road against Los Angeles.</p>
<h1 id="State-Sports-Gambling-Officials-Expect-Heavy-Wagering-on-Rams-vs-Falcons-Game"><a href="#State-Sports-Gambling-Officials-Expect-Heavy-Wagering-on-Rams-vs-Falcons-Game" class="headerlink" title="State Sports Gambling Officials Expect Heavy Wagering on Rams vs. Falcons Game"></a>State Sports Gambling Officials Expect Heavy Wagering on Rams vs. Falcons Game</h1><p>The Rams and Falcons are set to face off in the Wildcard round of the NFL Playoffs and state sports gambling officials expect heavy wagering on the game.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of money to be made on this game, and we anticipate that people will bet big on both sides,” said a spokesperson for the Nevada Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>Las Vegas oddsmakers have made the Rams a four-point favorite, but many believe that the line is too low and that the Falcons could pull off an upset.</p>
<p>“I like Atlanta to win outright,” said one gambler. “The Rams have been overrated all year.”</p>
<p>Others believe that the Rams are still the team to beat and that they will come out on top on Saturday.</p>
<p>No matter which team you think will win, there is sure to be plenty of action when these two teams face off this weekend. Make sure to place your bets and enjoy the game!</p>
<h1 id="Atlanta-Falcons-Fail-to-Cover-Point-Spread-in-Second-Straight-Game"><a href="#Atlanta-Falcons-Fail-to-Cover-Point-Spread-in-Second-Straight-Game" class="headerlink" title="Atlanta Falcons Fail to Cover Point Spread in Second Straight Game"></a>Atlanta Falcons Fail to Cover Point Spread in Second Straight Game</h1><p>The Atlanta Falcons were unable to cover the point spread in their second straight game, this time losing to the New Orleans Saints by a score of 43-37. The Falcons had been favored by 3 points in the game, but were unable to hold on to their lead late in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>This marks the second straight game in which the Falcons have failed to cover the point spread, and they will now need to turn things around quickly if they hope to make a run at the playoffs. The Falcons are currently sitting at 5-5 on the season, and will need to win some tough games down the stretch if they hope to make it into the postseason.</p>
<p>Matt Ryan had another big game for Atlanta, throwing for 417 yards and three touchdowns. Julio Jones was once again a major factor for the Falcons offense, catching 12 passes for 164 yards and a touchdown. However, Atlanta’s defense was unable to stop Drew Brees and the Saints offense, allowing 413 total yards in the loss.</p>
<p>The Falcons will next take on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 12.</p>
