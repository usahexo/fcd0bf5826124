It is a relatively new product, having been created in the early 2000s in response to the growing number of cyber attacks.\n\nDespite its recent origins, digital insurance has become increasingly popular and can be found in most major markets around the world. In the United States, for example, cyber insurance premiums totaled $1.3 billion in 2016 and are expected to grow by 10% annually through 2020.\n\nSo what factors influence the cost of digital insurance? And how can you save money on your policy?\n\nThe cost of digital insurance policies varies depending on a number of factors, including the size of the company, its industry, and the type and amount of coverage selected. However, there are some general guidelines that can help you understand how much your policy will cost.\n\nGenerally speaking, small businesses can expect to pay between $500 and $5,000 for a year's worth of coverage, while larger companies can expect to pay more than $100,000 per year. However, these numbers are just averages and prices may vary significantly depending on the insurer.\n\nAnother important factor that affects price is whether or not you have suffered a data breach in the past. If you have had a breach in the past, your premium will be higher than if you have not had one. This is because insurers see companies that have had breaches as being more risky and therefore charge them more for coverage.\n\nThere are also a number of ways that businesses can save money on their digital insurance policies. The most important way to save money is to shop around for the best deal. There are a number of different insurers offering cyber insurance policies, so it is important to compare rates before selecting a policy.\n\nBusinesses can also save money by increasing their deductible amount. The deductible is the amount that the business must pay out-of-pocket before the insurer begins paying claims. By increasing the deductible amount, businesses can reduce their premiums costs.\n\nFinally, businesses can save money by selecting a policy that covers only specific risks rather than all risks associated with data breaches. For example, a business might choose to only cover losses resulting from ransomware attacks or stolen laptops rather than all possible risks. This allows businesses to tailor their policies to their specific needs and reduces their premiums costs.\n\n#  What is the process of getting digital insurance for your online business?\n\nWhen you are looking for digital insurance, the first step is to find an insurance agent. Once you have found one, they will help you review your existing policies and see if there is anything that needs to be updated or added.\n\nThe next step is to identify what type of coverage you need. Your agent will help you navigate this process by asking a series of questions about your business. Some of the factors that will be considered include the number of employees, the type of products or services offered, and the company's annual revenue.\n\nOnce the type of coverage has been identified, the agent will help you find a policy that meets your needs. This may include property damage insurance, product liability insurance, and cyber liability insurance.\n\nIf you have any questions about the process or need help finding an agent, please contact us at [INSERT YOUR COMPANY WEBSITE].\n\n#  What are the exclusions of coverage with digital insurance?\n\nAs with any type of insurance policy, there are exclusions of coverage. This is also true with digital insurance policies. There are certain items that are not covered under a digital insurance policy.\n\nOne exclusion of coverage is damage to electronic media that is not related to a specific peril like fire or water damage. So, for example, if your computer is damaged as a result of a power surge, that would be covered by your digital insurance policy. However, if your computer is damaged as a result of a virus or other type of malware, that would not be covered.\n\nAnother exclusion of coverage with digital insurance policies is the theft of electronic equipment that is not connected to a specific peril. For example, if someone steals your laptop from your home, that would be covered by your digital insurance policy. However, if someone steals your smartphone from your purse, that would not be covered.\n\nThere are also certain perils that are specifically excluded from coverage under digital insurance policies. These include hacking and cybercrime, data loss or corruption, and failure of electronic equipment.\n\nIt's important to understand the exclusions of coverage when you are considering purchasing a digital insurance policy. Make sure you are aware of what is and isn't covered so you can make an informed decision about whether this type of coverage is right for you.","source":"_posts/What-is-digital-insurance.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is digital insurance\ndate: 2022-09-09 16:51:39\ncategories:\n- Insurance\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is digital insurance?\n\nDigital insurance is a term used to describe the transfer of risk from an individual or organization to an insurer using digital technology.

This is also true with digital insurance policies. There are certain items that are not covered under a digital insurance policy.</p>\n<p>One exclusion of coverage is damage to electronic media that is not related to a specific peril like fire or water damage. So, for example, if your computer is damaged as a result of a power surge, that would be covered by your digital insurance policy. However, if your computer is damaged as a result of a virus or other type of malware, that would not be covered.</p>\n<p>Another exclusion of coverage with digital insurance policies is the theft of electronic equipment that is not connected to a specific peril. For example, if someone steals your laptop from your home, that would be covered by your digital insurance policy. However, if someone steals your smartphone from your purse, that would not be covered.</p>\n<p>There are also certain perils that are specifically excluded from coverage under digital insurance policies. These include hacking and cybercrime, data loss or corruption, and failure of electronic equipment.</p>\n<p>It’s important to understand the exclusions of coverage when you are considering purchasing a digital insurance policy. Make sure you are aware of what is and isn’t covered so you can make an informed decision about whether this type of coverage is right for you.</p>\n"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[{"post_id":"cl7u8osd80001nkv55tkufkik","category_id":"cl7u8osdc0003nkv515ijba8x","_id":"cl7u8osde0004nkv50ewhf7tk"}],"PostTag":[],"Tag":[]}}
