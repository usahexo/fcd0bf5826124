#  What does Flaubert mean?

The term "Flaubertian" has been used to describe writers who aim for exactitude in their use of language and who favor deliberation and precision in their style. Gustave Flaubert, the author of Madame Bovary, is often cited as an exemplary Flaubertian writer.

Flaubert was born in Rouen, France in 1821. After a traditional education, he traveled extensively throughout Europe and North Africa before settling in Paris, where he began writing seriously. His first novel, Salammb√¥, was published in 1862. The following year, he published Madame Bovary, which is now considered a classic of French literature.

Flaubert's reputation rests largely on his novels, but he was also an accomplished short story writer and essayist. He believed that the novelist's task was to capture everyday reality in all its richness and complexity and to render it with absolute accuracy. For Flaubert, the artist's task was not to impose his own vision on the world but to faithfully represent it as it is.

In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Flaubert developed a painstaking writing process that involved repeated revisions and careful attention to detail. He famously said that "a word must be placed at the right place." This insistence on precision led him to create some of the most memorable characters and scenes in French literature.

Despite his dedication to realism, Flaubert was not immune to bouts of inspiration. In fact, many of his most famous passages were written quickly and spontaneously. These moments of inspiration were often followed by long periods of reflection and revision as Flaubert worked to perfect his prose.

Flaubert's influence on French literature is immense. He helped pioneer the realist movement in fiction and inspired generations of writers with his passion for accuracy and attention to detail. His work continues to be read and studied around the world more than 150 years after it was first published.
