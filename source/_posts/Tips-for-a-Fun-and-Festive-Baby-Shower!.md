4. Serve themed snacks and drinks such as animal crackers, fruit punch served in plastic baby bottles, or mini hamburgers and hot dogs.

5. Have fun games planned for the guests such as “guess the weight of the baby” or “ naming the baby clothes.” You could also play traditional party games like Pin the Tail on the Donkey or musical chairs.

6. Set up a photobooth using props like teddy bears, diapers, and booties to create memorable keepsakes for guests.

#  The Best Ways to Entertain Guests at a Baby Shower

There are many things to consider when planning a baby shower, from the decorations and food to the games and entertainment. One of the most important aspects of any baby shower is ensuring that guests are having fun and enjoying themselves. If you’re looking for some ideas on how to entertain your guests, read on for some of the best ways to do just that!

One classic way to keep guests entertained is by playing games. There are many different games that can be played at a baby shower, ranging from simple guessing games to more challenging ones that require some teamwork or strategy. If you’re looking for something fun and easy, why not try a game of “baby shower bingo”? Guests can take turns drawing cards with different items or activities related to babies on them, and then they have to find someone who has that item or has done that activity. For a more challenging game, you could try a trivia quiz about babies. This can be a great way to test guests’ knowledge about all things baby-related!

Another fun idea for keeping guests entertained is by having a photobooth. This is especially popular at modern baby showers, where everyone likes to take selfies and capture memories of the day. You can either set up your own photobooth using props and backdrops, or you can ask someone else in attendance to do it for you. Photobooths are always a lot of fun, and they provide an opportunity for guests to get creative with their photos!

If you want to keep things low-key, you could also simply put together a playlist of catchy baby songs and let guests listen while they chat. Or you could show some funny parenting videos online – there are plenty of them out there! Whatever option you choose, be sure to keep your guests engaged and entertained throughout the duration of the baby shower.

#  Clever Ideas for Baby Shower Favors 

When it comes to baby shower favors, there are all sorts of different things you can do. You can go the traditional route and give out small gifts or treats to guests, or you can get a little bit more creative and come up with something unique. If you’re looking for some clever ideas for baby shower favors, here are a few suggestions to get you started:

1. Customized candy bars: These make a great favor for any type of shower, but they’re especially perfect for a baby shower. You can find companies that will print custom labels for your candy bars, so you can create a personalized message that celebrates the new arrival.

2. Mini potted plants: Potted plants make a beautiful and thoughtful favor for any type of shower, but they’re especially perfect for a baby shower. They can serve as a reminder of the new life that’s been welcomed into the world, and they also make cute decorations for the party itself.

3. Baby photo frames: Photo frames are always a popular choice for baby shower favors, and it’s easy to see why. They’re practical and sentimental, and guests can use them to display photos of the new baby once the party is over.

4. Personalized thank-you cards: This is another simple but very meaningful favor idea. You can have personalized thank-you cards printed up with the baby’s name and birth date, and guests can use them to send well wishes to the new parents after the shower is over.

5. Customized cookies: Cookies are always a hit as a party favor, and you can take things one step further by having them customized with the baby’s name and birth date. This is a sweet way to thank guests for coming to the shower and celebrating the new arrival!

#  How to Plan the Perfect Baby Shower on a Budget

A baby shower is a great way to celebrate the pending arrival of a new addition to your family and friends. It can also be a fun event to plan, whether you are the host or a guest. If you are on a budget, there are plenty of ways to plan a wonderful shower without spending a lot of money.

The first step is to decide on a budget. This will help you determine what type of shower you can throw. If you have a limited budget, consider having a smaller shower with close friends and family members. You can also save money by not serving any food or drinks at the party.

If you want to serve food and drinks, there are many affordable options available. You can serve simple snacks like fruit or chips and dip, or have a potluck dinner where everyone brings a dish to share. For drinks, consider serving iced tea or water instead of soda or alcohol.

Another way to save money is by using disposable plates, cups, and napkins. This will also make cleanup easier for you after the party. Another option is to decorate using items that you already have around the house. Flowers, balloons, and streamers can all add festive decoration without costing anything extra.

If you want to purchase party supplies, look for sales at local stores or online retailers. You can also find affordable invitations and thank-you cards online or through discount websites.

By following these tips, you can plan an affordable baby shower that everyone will enjoy!
