#  Speed Baccarat 13 legal only at select casinos!

Speed Baccarat is one of the latest versions of this classic casino game and can now only be played legally at a handful of casinos around the world. The game is played with six decks of cards, which are shuffled together and placed in the shoe. The player then bets on either the Banker or the Player. After all bets have been placed, the first card is dealt face up to the Banker and the second card is dealt face up to the Player. If either of these cards is an Ace, it is counted as 1 point. The rest of the cards are counted at their face value. If the total points are 8 or 9, this is called a natural and no further cards are drawn. If the total points are anything else, both players draw one more card each and the highest point total between them wins (unless one has a natural – in which case they automatically win).

The beauty of Speed Baccarat is that it moves quickly – hence the name! – so you can get through more hands per hour than you would in traditional baccarat. This makes it an appealing option for players who want to get stuck into a game without spending too much time on each hand. It’s also great for those who like to keep things exciting by playing multiple hands simultaneously!

Whilst Speed Baccarat can be enjoyed at a few select casinos, it’s not available at all gaming venues so be sure to head to one of our recommended sites if you want to try your luck.
