#  How to Play Double Soccer Ball Roulette Flaubert - A Fun and Exciting Way to Spend an Evening!

Double Soccer Ball Roulette Flaubert is a fun and exciting way to spend an evening with friends. The game can be played with any number of players, but it is best with at least six. Players are also required to have two soccer balls.

To set up the game, divide the players into two teams, Team A and Team B. Position Team A on one side of the room and Team B on the other. Have each player stand in a column, with the first player in line facing the wall.

Next, place the two soccer balls at opposite ends of the playing area. One ball should be placed near Team A’s end line and the other ball should be placed near Team B’s end line.

The game begins with the first player in each team taking a turn kicking one of the soccer balls. The player must kick the ball so that it goes across the playing area and bounces off of one of the walls before ending up at the other team’s end line. If a player misses or kicks their ball out of bounds, they must retrieve it and then take another turn.

If a player successfully kicks their ball so that it goes across and bounces off of one of the walls before ending up at the other team’s end line, their team earns one point. The first team to earn five points wins!
