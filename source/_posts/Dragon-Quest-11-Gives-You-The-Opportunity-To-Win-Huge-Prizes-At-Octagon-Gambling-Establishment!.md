The first floor of the Octagon has a time limit of 2 minutes. You need to make your way through the enemies as quickly as possible and reach the exit.

Dragon Quest is an array of video games created by Enix (now Square Enix). The first game in the series was discharged in 1986. The Dragon Quest octagon establishment provides participants the chance to bet on the result of 8 different online pokies games, with chances varying from 1 in 10 to 1 in 3,000. In order to participate, one merely bets 100 credits and clicks on the icons of the games they believe will generate winning combinations.

The games are displayed on a big monitor at the front of the establishment, and as each game progresses, its payout percentage is announced. If a player has wagered on that game and has selected more than one icon, their winnings are multiplied by the number of correct selections. For instance if a player wagered 10 credits and picked 5 icons for a particular game that was currently underway with a payout percentage announced as 95%, their total winnings would be 950 credits (95% of 10 x 5 = 475 credits).

If no announcement is made for a particular game, it can be assumed that the payout percentage is 100%. In this case, picking all 7 icons would result in a 700 credit payout (7 x 100 = 700 credits).
