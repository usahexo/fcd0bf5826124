#  Gambler's Ruin in Aquila Basket Trento? Not Likely - The New York Times

The NBA playoffs are in full swing and while there are a few surprises so far, one outcome is looking more and more likely with each passing day: the Golden State Warriors will be crowned champions. The biggest surprise may be the team from Aquila Basket Trento, who many thought would at least make it to the semi-finals.

But before we write them off completely, let's take a closer look at their odds of upsetting the Warriors. It's no secret that the Warriors are one of the most formidable teams in NBA history - they have set multiple records this season, including most wins in a regular season.

In contrast, Aquila Basket Trento is a relatively new team, formed only in 2014. They do have some talented players, but they are no match for the Warriors when it comes to experience or firepower. So why did their odds suddenly spike?

It could be because the Golden State Warriors have been resting some of their key players ahead of the playoffs. This could leave them vulnerable against a team like Aquila Basket Trento, which is known for its aggressive play style. However, as soon as Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant get back on the court, expect the Warriors to dominate as they usually do.

Aquila Basket Trento may put up a good fight, but in the end they will be defeated by the Golden State Warriors.
