#  Play Poker Online With Friends Villarreal CF Style

Looking for a fun and exciting way to spend time with friends? Why not play some poker online together?! Villarreal CF style of course!

There are many different poker variants that can be played online, but the most popular is Texas Hold’em. Before getting started, it is important to learn the basic rules of the game.

Each player is dealt two cards face down, which are known as their hole cards. The aim of the game is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of your two hole cards and the five community cards on the table.

The player who bets the most money at any given point in the hand is known as the ‘big blind’. The second player to bet is known as the ‘small blind’. The small blind always bets half of what the big blind has bet.

The following are the three main betting rounds in Texas Hold’em: preflop, flop and turn.

The preflop betting round begins when the first three community cards (the flop) are placed face-up on the table. Players then have a chance to bet, check (remain in without betting) or fold (quit the hand). The amount that can be bet depends on how much has been raised before them.

If no one has raised, then you can only bet up to the size of your original bet (or call). If someone has raised, then you can reraise (raise again), call (match their raise) or fold.


To enter a Texas Hold’em game, visit a reputable online poker room and choose a table that corresponds with your bankroll size – remember, you don’t want to lose all your money in one sitting! After selecting your table, click on Play Now and you will be seated at a random seat alongside seven other players.

Once everyone has had a chance to look at their cards, it is time for the flop round. In this round, three more community cards are placed face-up on the table. At this point in the hand, each player will have six cards: two hole cards and four community cards.
Not all players will necessarily see all six of these cards – some may have folded before seeing any Flop cards come out). The aim now is to use any combination of these six cards to make the best five-card poker hand possible.

    Betting now commences with the player seated left of the big blind (known as UTG – Under The Gun), who must act first. Play then continues clockwise around the table until everyone has either folded or put in a final bet; this last person is known as being ‘all-in’ and cannot bet any more money.

The next card to come out is known as fourth street or turn, followed by fifth street or river. These are also called streets because they come out one at a time just like cars on a street). By this point in the game, there should only be one or two players remaining as all others would have folded (or lost all their money!).

   At showdown, both remaining players reveal their hands and whoever has made the best five-card poker hand using any combination of their two hole cards and five community cards wins!
