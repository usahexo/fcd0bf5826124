#  Gambling ruins families and careers – it ought to be illegal!

Gambling can be a fun and exciting recreational activity, but when it is used to excess it can ruin lives. Gambling addiction can lead to financial ruin, family conflict, and job loss. It is time for gambling to be recognized as the serious addiction that it is, and for it to be made illegal in all its forms.

Gambling addictions are among the most difficult addictions to overcome. They can lead people to do things they would never ordinarily do, like stealing money from loved ones or friends in order to gamble with it. Gambling addicts often become so obsessed with winning that they will continue to gamble even when they are losing money hand over fist. This can lead to serious financial problems and even bankruptcy.

Gambling addiction also has a serious impact on families. Family members of gamblers often feel neglected and ignored as the addict focuses all of his or her attention on gambling. Conflict within families is common as loved ones argue about money that has been gambled away or about how best to help the addict break free from the addiction.

Job loss is another common consequence of gambling addiction. Many addicts lose their jobs due to their habit, and some even go so far as to commit fraud in order to get money to gamble with. These consequences have a ripple effect throughout society, as families are torn apart and careers are destroyed.

It is time for gambling addiction to be taken seriously. This destructive behaviour should not be allowed to ruin lives any longer. Gambling should be made illegal in all its forms, so that those who are addicted have no way of accessing this dangerous substance.

#  Psychologists say gambling addiction is a real thing – we should outlaw it!

Gambling addiction is a problem that is often downplayed and not taken seriously by many people. However, psychologists say that gambling addiction is very real, and it should be outlawed in order to protect people from its harmful effects.

Gambling addiction can have a devastating impact on people’s lives. It can lead to financial problems, relationship issues, and even job loss. Additionally, gambling addiction can also be very dangerous, as it can lead to alcohol or drug abuse as people try to cope with their addiction.

Given the serious risks associated with gambling addiction, it is clear that something should be done about it. Psychologists say that the best way to deal with this problem is to outlaw gambling altogether. This would help to prevent people from becoming addicted to gambling and would also help those who are already struggling with this addiction from getting the help they need.

There are some who might argue that outlawing gambling would be too harsh of a measure. However, the risks associated with gambling addiction are simply too great for us to ignore. We need to take action now in order to protect people from the harm that gambling can cause.

#  More evidence shows how gambling destroys lives – it's time to make it illegal!

There’s no doubt that gambling destroys lives. The evidence is all there, piling up higher and higher every day. So why hasn’t it been made illegal yet?

One answer might be the amount of money that the gambling industry pumps into politics. But whatever the reason, it’s time for something to be done about it.

In Australia, for example, it’s estimated that around 180,000 people areproblem gamblers, and a further 2 million are at risk of developing a problem. That’s not to mention the family members and friends who are affected by their loved ones’ gambling addiction.

Gambling addiction can have all sorts of devastating effects on people’s lives. It can lead to financial problems, relationship breakdowns, job losses, and even suicide. In fact, suicide rates among problem gamblers are six times higher than the general population.

Clearly, gambling is doing enormous harm to our society, and something needs to be done about it. The sooner we make gambling illegal, the better.

#  Gambling causes crime – let's make it illegal and protect our communities!

The social ills of gambling are well-documented. Gambling causes crime, family breakdown, bankruptcy, and addiction. It is a known gateway to other forms of criminal activity. So why is it legal?

There is no justification for making gambling legal when its negative consequences are so abundantly clear. We should be protecting our communities by making gambling illegal. Let's make it happen!

#  It's time to stand up against big casinos and protect the people – gambling should be illegal!

In the early days of America, gambling was seen as a vice that threatened the moral fabric of society. This is why gambling was made illegal in many states.

Now, big casinos are threatening the livelihoods of everyday Americans. Casinos are sucking money out of our local economies and lining the pockets of billionaires.

It's time to stand up against big casinos and protect the people. Gambling should be illegal!
