#  Learn about the benefits of base points and how to use them when playing Starstruck at the Isle of Capri Casino in Boonville!

When playing at the casino, there are a number of different things you can do in order to increase your chances of winning. One such technique is to use base points. What are they and how can you make the most of them?

Base points, also known as loyalty points, are essentially rewards that casinos offer to players for their loyalty. They can be earned by playing any game at the casino, whether it’s slots, blackjack, or roulette. The amount you earn may vary depending on the game you play and your betting level, but typically it’s around one point for every $10 wagered.

Once you have accrued a certain number of base points – usually between 500 and 1,000 – you can redeem them for various benefits, such as free casino chips, complimentary hotel stays, or even cash back. This makes them a valuable tool to have in your arsenal when playing at the casino, as they can help reduce your overall expenses.

So how can you make the most of your base points? Here are a few tips:

1) Make sure you sign up for the casino’s loyalty program. This is where you can track your progress and redeem your points.

2) Choose games that offer higher base point rewards. Blackjack and roulette are two great examples, as they offer 1-2 points per $10 wagered.

3) Play regularly. The more often you play, the more points you’ll earn, which will accelerate your progress towards redemption.

4) Stick to a budget. It’s important to remember that base points should not be viewed as free money – they should be considered an added bonus on top of your regular winnings. So don’t go overboard with your betting just because you have some extra points to spare!
